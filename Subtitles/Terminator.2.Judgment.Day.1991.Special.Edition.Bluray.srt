1
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:24,199
<i>Three billion human lives ended
on August 29, 1997.</i>

2
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:26,409
<i>The survivors of the nuclear fire...</i>

3
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:29,211
<i>called the war “Judgment Day.”</i>

4
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:32,381
<i>They lived only to face
a new nightmare —</i>

5
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,504
<i>the war against the machines.</i>

6
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:56,416
<i>The computer which controlled
the machines, Skynet...</i>

7
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,502
<i>sent two Terminators
back through time.</i>

8
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:03,635
<i>Their mission: to destroy the leader
of the human resistance.</i>

9
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,558
<i>John Connor, my son.</i>

10
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:14,851
<i>The first Terminator was programmed
to strike at me in the year 1984...</i>

11
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:17,277
<i>before john was born.</i>

12
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,196
<i>It failed.</i>

13
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:22,115
<i>The second was set to strike
at John himself...</i>

14
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,660
<i>when he was still a child.</i>

15
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:32,080
<i>As before, the resistance was able
to send a lone warrior...</i>

16
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,457
<i>a protector for john.</i>

17
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:37,961
<i>It was just a question of which one
of them would reach him first.</i>

18
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:56,090
I need your clothes, your boots
and your motorcycle.

19
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,067
You forgot to say please.

20
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,127
Get him off me!

21
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,224
Pull it out!

22
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,963
Take it.

23
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,401
Can't let you take
the man's wheels, son.

24
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:41,988
Now, get off
before I put you down.

25
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:53,294
That's it, goddamn it.

26
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,103
R-31 David, Sherman Code 6...

27
00:10:56,197 --> 00:11:00,907
at the Sixth Street Bridge and Santa Fe
on electrical disturbance.

28
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,235
<i>Ten-four, R-31 David.</i>

29
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,089
John, get in there and clean up
that pigsty of yours.

30
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:57,061
Your foster parents
are kind of dicks, huh?

31
00:12:57,151 --> 00:13:00,234
I swear, I have had it
with that goddamn kid.

32
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,938
- He won't even answer me anymore.
- Honey, move.

33
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,945
Would you get off your butt
and help me?

34
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,868
- Todd!
- What?

35
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:12,289
He hasn't cleaned that room of his
in a month.

36
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,538
Oh, it's an emergency.
Hang on. I'll get right on it.

37
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,459
Come on.

38
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:28,593
Get your ass inside.
Do what your mother tells you.

39
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,558
She's not my mother, Todd.

40
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,746
<i>This next patient is interesting.</i>

41
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,298
I've been following the case
for years.

42
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,466
A 29-year-old female...

43
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,467
diagnosed as acute
schizo-affective disorder.

44
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:13,801
The usual indicators: depression,
anxiety, violent acting out...

45
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,602
delusions of persecution.

46
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:25,396
<i>The delusional architecture
is fairly unique.</i>

47
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,323
She believes that a machine
called the Terminator...

48
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,743
which looks human,
was sent back through time...

49
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,866
- to kill her.
- That's original.

50
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:37,199
And also that the father
of her child...

51
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:40,536
was a soldier sent back
to protect her.

52
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,541
He was from the future too.

53
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:47,251
The year 2029,
if I remember correctly.

54
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,586
And here we are.

55
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:51,463
<i>Morning, Sarah.</i>

56
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:59,771
Good morning, Dr. Silberman.
How's the knee?

57
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,520
<i>Fine, Sarah.</i>

58
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,895
She stabbed me in the kneecap...

59
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:10,527
with my pen a few weeks ago.

60
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,108
Repeated escape attempts.

61
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,629
Let's move on, shall we?

62
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:28,049
I don't like to see the patients
disrupting their rooms like this.

63
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:31,504
- See she takes her Thorazine.
- Sure. I'll take care of it.

64
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:47,318
It's time to take your meds, Connor.

65
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,146
You take it.

66
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,574
Now you know you gotta be good.
You're up for review this afternoon.

67
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,571
I'm not taking it, Dougie.

68
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,700
- I don't want any trouble.
- Ain't no trouble.

69
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,040
Zap her.

70
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,632
Last call, sugar.

71
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,640
Sweet dreams.

72
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,255
Are you the legal guardian
of John Connor?

73
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:01,017
That's right, Officer.
What's he done now?

74
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:04,061
- Could I speak with him, please?
- You could if he were here.

75
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:07,015
He took off on his bike this morning.
He could be anywhere.

76
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,396
Do you have a photograph of John?

77
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:10,727
Yeah. Hold on.

78
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,899
Gonna tell me what this is about?

79
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,576
I just need to ask him
a few questions.

80
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:23,536
He's a good-looking boy.
Do you mind if I keep this picture?

81
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:27,119
No, go on. There was a guy here
this morning looking for him too.

82
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,375
Yeah, a big guy on a bike.

83
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,923
Has that got something
to do with this?

84
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:38,346
I wouldn't worry about him.

85
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:41,220
Thanks for your cooperation.

86
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,262
Please insert your stolen card now.

87
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,271
PIN number.

88
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,073
Hurry up. This is taking too long.

89
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,649
Go, baby.

90
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:01,702
All right.

91
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:05,498
- PIN number 9003.
- Where'd you learn this stuff from?

92
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,077
From my mom.
My real mom, I mean.

93
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:12,414
Withdraw 300 bucks.

94
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:15,250
Come on, baby. Come on!

95
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,585
- Yes!
- Hey, it worked.

96
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,344
All right. Easy money.
Come on!

97
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,969
Yes! Piece of cake.

98
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:34,353
- Is that her?
- Yes.

99
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,279
She's pretty cool, huh?

100
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,606
No, she's a complete psycho.

101
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,443
That's why she's at Pescadero.
It's a mental institute.

102
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,197
She tried to blow up a computer factory
but got shot and arrested.

103
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,374
No shit.

104
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,453
She's a total loser.

105
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,289
Come on.
Let's go spend some money.

106
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:25,286
Sarah, wake up.

107
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,087
Kyle.

108
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,128
You're dead.

109
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:40,256
Where's our son, Sarah?

110
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,504
They took him away from me.

111
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,808
- He's the target now.
- I know.

112
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,931
He's all alone.
You have to protect him.

113
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,479
I know.

114
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,148
You tell me
how I'm supposed to do that.

115
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:56,351
He doesn't even believe me anymore.

116
00:19:56,445 --> 00:20:00,484
- I've lost him.
- You're strong, Sarah.

117
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,986
Stronger than you ever thought
you could be.

118
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,447
On your feet, soldier!

119
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:10,369
I love you, Sarah.
I always will.

120
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,583
- I need you.
- I'll always be with you.

121
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,961
Remember the message?

122
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,841
The future is not set.

123
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:29,600
There is no fate
but what we make for ourselves.

124
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,493
Stay with me.

125
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,327
There's not much time left
in the world, Sarah.

126
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,627
Kyle, don't go!

127
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:34,266
<i>It's like a giant strobe light...</i>

128
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,685
<i>burning right through my eyes.</i>

129
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:43,185
<i>Somehow I can still see.</i>

130
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,987
<i>Oh, God.</i>

131
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:57,790
<i>We know the dream's the same
every night.</i>

132
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:01,290
<i>- Why do I have to —
- Please continue.</i>

133
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,709
<i>Children look like burnt paper.</i>

134
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,462
<i>Black.</i>

135
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,468
<i>Not moving.</i>

136
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:17,723
<i>And then the blast wave hits them.</i>

137
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:29,739
<i>And they fly apart like leaves.</i>

138
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:34,861
<i>Dreams of cataclysm,
the end of the world...</i>

139
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,866
<i>are very common.</i>

140
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:42,828
<i>It's not a dream, you moron.
It's real.</i>

141
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:46,836
<i>- I know the date it happens.
- I'm sure it feels real to you.</i>

142
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,418
<i>On August 29, 1997...</i>

143
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:53,004
<i>it's gonna feel
pretty fuckin' real to you too!</i>

144
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:56,762
<i>Anybody not wearing two-million
sunblock is gonna have a real bad day.</i>

145
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,763
<i>Get it?</i>

146
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,721
<i>God, you think
you're safe and alive.</i>

147
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:04,102
<i>You're already dead. Everybody!</i>

148
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:06,685
<i>Him. You. You're dead already.</i>

149
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:09,646
<i>This whole place,
everything you see is gone!</i>

150
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:13,825
<i>You're the one living in the dream,
'cause I know it happens!</i>

151
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:15,868
<i>It happens!</i>

152
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,832
I feel much better now.

153
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:31,793
Clearer.

154
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,675
Yes, your attitude has been...

155
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:37,052
much improved lately.

156
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,894
It's helped me to have a goal...

157
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:52,151
something to look forward to.

158
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:53,402
What is that?

159
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,824
Well, you said...

160
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:59,745
that if I showed improvement
after six months...

161
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:02,494
you would transfer me
to the minimum security wing...

162
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,326
and I could have visitors.

163
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:11,003
Well, it's been six months and...

164
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:14,423
I was looking forward
to seeing my son.

165
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,928
I see.

166
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:24,349
Let's go back to what you were saying
about those Terminator machines.

167
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,892
Now you think they don't exist?

168
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:33,105
They don't exist.
I know that now.

169
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:36,361
But you've told me on many occasions
about how you crushed one...

170
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:38,534
in a hydraulic press.

171
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:43,031
If I had, there would have
been some evidence.

172
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:45,537
They would have found something
at the factory.

173
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,709
I see.

174
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:51,209
<i>So you don't believe anymore
that the company covered it up?</i>

175
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:56,377
<i>No. Why would they?</i>

176
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:59,715
Let's try a new position
right there.

177
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,141
Mr. Dyson?

178
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,647
The materials team
is running another —

179
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,402
- Mr. Dyson.
- Yes?

180
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:20,451
The materials team is running
another series this afternoon.

181
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:23,495
You have to sign for the — it.

182
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,415
- You have to sign it out.
- Okay. I'll get it.

183
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:32,417
I know I haven't been here long,
but I was wondering if you know —

184
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:33,873
Know what?

185
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,584
If you know where “it” came from.

186
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:40,091
I asked them the same question once.
You know what they told me?

187
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:42,139
Don't ask.

188
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:51,103
- Good morning, Mr. Dyson.
- How's it going?

189
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:54,106
Insert key. Left on three.

190
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,528
Two, one, turn.

191
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,861
- How are the wife and kids?
- Great. Thanks.

192
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:33,103
So what do you think, Doctor?

193
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:35,943
Haven't I shown improvement?

194
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,985
Well, Sarah, here's the problem.

195
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,488
I know how smart you are.

196
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,616
You're just telling me
what I want to hear.

197
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,703
I don't think you really believe
what you're telling me today.

198
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:53,707
If I put you in minimum security,
you'll just try to escape again.

199
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:00,839
You have to let me see my son.

200
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,679
Please.

201
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,853
He's in great danger.
He's naked without me.

202
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:13,730
If I could make a phone call —

203
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:16,275
I'm afraid not.
Not for a while.

204
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,946
I don't see any choice but to
recommend to the review board...

205
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:23,616
that you stay here
for another six months.

206
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:30,076
I'll kill you,
you son of a bitch!

207
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:33,788
You son of a bitch!

208
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:38,422
Ten CCs of sodium amobarbital, stat!

209
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:41,421
- You don't know what you're doing!
- Get some restraints in here now!

210
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:46,972
You don't know what you're doing!

211
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:53,099
<i>Model citizen.</i>

212
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,853
You just missed him.
He was here 15 minutes ago.

213
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,103
- He was going to the galleria.
- Yeah.

214
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,979
The galleria?

215
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:28,407
I'm gonna get some quarters.
I'll be back, all right?

216
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,133
- Oh, no!
- Girls, do you know John Connor?

217
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:52,632
Hey, do you know this guy?

218
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:54,888
Nah, I don't know him.

219
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,600
- John.
- Not now.

220
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,937
There's this cop scoping for you.
Check it out.

221
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:10,403
- He's right over there.
- Split, man.

222
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:12,952
- Just go.
- Yeah.

223
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:18,907
I saw that kid —

224
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,178
You're not supposed to
be in here!

225
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,126
Get down.

226
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:16,071
Mister, are you all right?

227
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,406
You all right?

228
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,926
Come on!

229
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,259
Goddamn!

230
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:58,083
Okay, time-out.
Stop the bike.

231
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,752
Time-out.
Come on, stop the bike.

232
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:16,560
Holy shit.
Now, don't take this the wrong way.

233
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:19,013
- You are a Terminator, right?
- Yes.

234
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:21,940
Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.

235
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:35,449
Holy shit.

236
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:39,541
You're really real.

237
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,584
I mean —

238
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:47,048
You're like a machine underneath,
right?

239
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,625
But alive outside?

240
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,631
I'm a cybernetic organism.

241
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:53,430
Living tissue
over metal endoskeleton.

242
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,401
This is intense.

243
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:13,279
Get a grip, John. Okay.

244
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,988
You're not here to kill me.

245
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:22,041
I figured that part out for myself.
So what's the deal?

246
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:27,544
- My mission is to protect you.
- Yeah? Who sent you?

247
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,876
You did.
Thirty-five years from now...

248
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:34,964
you reprogrammed me to be
your protector here in this time.

249
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:37,800
Oh, this is deep.

250
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:03,241
So this other guy,
he's a Terminator like you, right?

251
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:07,037
Not like me.
A T-1000, advanced prototype.

252
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:10,461
More advanced than you are?

253
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:15,045
- Yes. A mimetic poly-alloy.
- What the hell does that mean?

254
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:19,383
- Liquid metal.
- Where are we going?

255
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:22,811
We have to get out of the city
immediately and avoid the authorities.

256
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,605
I gotta stop by my house.
I wanna pick up some stuff.

257
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:30,482
Negative. The T-1000 would definitely
try to reacquire you there.

258
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:33,313
- You sure?
- I would.

259
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,580
Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks...

260
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,337
but I gotta warn 'em.

261
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:52,792
Shit. You got a quarter?

262
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:04,553
- Hello.
<i>- Janelle, it's me.</i>

263
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:07,014
- John?
<i>- Is everything all right?</i>

264
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:09,520
- Are you guys okay?
<i>- Sure, honey, everything's okay.</i>

265
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,693
- Are you all right?
<i>- Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

266
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:16,364
John, it's late.
I was beginning to worry about you.

267
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:19,159
If you hurry home, we can sit down
and have dinner together.

268
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,781
I'm making beef stew.

269
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:23,785
Somethings wrong.
She's never this nice.

270
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,661
Where are you?

271
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:28,619
What the hell is
the goddamn dog barking at?

272
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:31,956
Hey, shut up,
you worthless piece of shit!

273
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,506
The dog's really barking.

274
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:35,800
You were gonna tell the kid
to get rid of that mutt.

275
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:42,466
John, it's late.
Please don't make me worry.

276
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,267
Could he already be there?

277
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,682
Are you okay?

278
00:42:46,773 --> 00:42:50,767
- I'm fight here. I'm fine.
<i>- Are you sure you're all right?</i>

279
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:54,194
- What's the dog's name?
- Max.

280
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,612
Hey, Janelle.
What's wrong with Wolfie?

281
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:59,282
I can hear him barking.
Is he okay?

282
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:03,236
Wolfie's fine, honey.
Wolfie's just fine.

283
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:04,992
Where are you?

284
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:07,665
Your foster parents are dead.

285
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,531
I need a minute here.

286
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:51,960
You're telling me that this thing
can imitate anything it touches?

287
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,959
Anything it samples
by physical contact.

288
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,460
Get real.

289
00:43:56,551 --> 00:44:00,294
It could disguise itself
as a pack of cigarettes?

290
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:02,299
No, only an object
of equal size.

291
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,757
Why not just become a bomb
or something to get me?

292
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:07,058
It can't form complex machines.

293
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:09,182
Guns and explosives
have chemicals, moving parts.

294
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:12,936
It doesn't work that way.
But it can form solid metal shapes.

295
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:16,063
- Like what?
- Knives and stabbing weapons.

296
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:49,058
These were taken by
a video surveillance camera...

297
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:52,638
at the West Highland Police Station
in 1984.

298
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:56,107
He killed 17 police officers
that night.

299
00:44:58,446 --> 00:45:00,483
Men with families...

300
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:03,485
children.

301
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,486
These were taken at a mall
in Reseda...

302
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,787
today.

303
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:14,167
Miss Connor, we know you know
who this guy is.

304
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:21,333
I just sat here and told you
that your son is missing...

305
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:24,260
that the foster parents
have been murdered.

306
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:26,088
We know this guy's involved.

307
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:30,475
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Don't you care?

308
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:39,022
We're wasting our time.
Let's go.

309
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:41,648
Sorry, guys.

310
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:46,028
She's grown more disconnected
from reality as time goes on.

311
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:48,325
I'm afraid she can't help us now.

312
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:51,621
If she clears at all and can
give us anything, I'll call you.

313
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,323
Sure.

314
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:56,375
Douglas, take her back to her room.

315
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:57,623
Yes, sir.

316
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:01,289
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.

317
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:03,420
You see...

318
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:06,720
we spent a lot of time in Nicaragua
and places like that.

319
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:12,309
For a while there, she was with
this crazy ex-Green Beret guy...

320
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:13,760
running guns.

321
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:16,767
Then there were some other guys.

322
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:18,848
She'd shack up with anybody
she could learn from...

323
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:22,186
so she could teach me how to be
this great military leader.

324
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:25,939
Then she gets busted.

325
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:29,651
It's like, “Sorry, kid, your mom's
a psycho. Didn't you know?”

326
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:35,786
Like everything I've been brought up
to believe is all made-up bullshit.

327
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,708
I hated her for that.

328
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:44,419
But everything she said was true.

329
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,677
She knew...

330
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:51,931
and nobody believed her...

331
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:55,597
not even me.

332
00:46:57,565 --> 00:46:59,431
Listen. We gotta get her
out of there.

333
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:02,893
Negative. The T-1000's highest
probability for success now...

334
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:06,025
will be to copy Sarah Connor and wait
for you to make contact with her.

335
00:47:06,115 --> 00:47:08,197
Great. What happens to her?

336
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:11,151
Typically, the subject being copied
is terminated.

337
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:14,488
Shit! Why didn't you tell me?
We gotta go right now!

338
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:16,664
Negative.
It's not a mission priority.

339
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:18,913
Fuck you!
She's a priority to me!

340
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:24,749
Goddamn it!
What's your problem? Help!

341
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,628
This does not help our mission.

342
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:29,177
Get this psycho off of me!
Help!

343
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:32,301
I'm being kidnapped!
Get this psycho off of me!

344
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:33,426
Let me go!

345
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,766
Why did you do that?

346
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:41,768
Because you told me to.

347
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:46,023
What?

348
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:53,034
You have to do what I say?

349
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,327
That's one of my mission parameters.

350
00:47:56,624 --> 00:47:59,742
Prove it.
Stand on one foot.

351
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:03,665
Yes!

352
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:09,467
Cool. My own Terminator. Wow.

353
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:12,211
You okay, kid?

354
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,671
Take a hike, bozo.

355
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:16,349
Let's get outta here, man.

356
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:18,301
Fuck you, you little dipshit!

357
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:20,516
Dipshit?

358
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:24,807
Put your leg down.

359
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:29,738
- Did you call <i>moi</i> a dipshit?
- Just trying to help this punk.

360
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:32,156
Grab this guy.

361
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:34,943
Get him off of me!

362
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:37,119
Now who's the dipshit...

363
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:38,992
you jock douche bag?

364
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:50,550
Put the gun down now!

365
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:53,845
- Get outta here!
- Come on. Let's split!

366
00:49:00,813 --> 00:49:02,724
You were gonna kill that guy!

367
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:04,977
Of course. I'm a Terminator.

368
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:09,811
Listen to me very carefully, okay?

369
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:13,239
You're not a Terminator anymore,
all right?

370
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:15,737
You got that?

371
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:18,069
You just can't go around
killing people.

372
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:19,199
Why?

373
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:22,323
What do you mean, why?
'Cause you can't.

374
00:49:23,419 --> 00:49:26,207
Because you just can't.
Trust me on this.

375
00:49:32,261 --> 00:49:35,720
Look. I'm gonna go get my mom.

376
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:38,639
I order you to help me.

377
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:08,618
You have a Sarah Connor here?

378
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:10,370
You're runnin' kind of late.

379
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:12,828
They've been in there for an hour.

380
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:15,333
Hold on a second.
I'll buzz you in.

381
00:52:17,176 --> 00:52:21,044
Oh, here come your friends now.

382
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:26,196
- Gwen, you want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

383
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:29,324
- How 'bout a beer?
- Yeah, right.

384
00:53:53,147 --> 00:53:56,435
- Hey, I got a full house.
- That's good, Louis.

385
00:53:56,525 --> 00:53:58,766
Must be my lucky day.

386
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:24,086
You're right about number 24.

387
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:27,164
Increase the medication
to 250 milligrams.

388
00:56:27,259 --> 00:56:30,126
- Same kind?
- Mm-hmm.

389
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:47,272
You!

390
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:51,692
You broke my arm.

391
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:54,571
There are 215 bones
in the human body.

392
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:57,244
That's one. Now, don't move.

393
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:04,918
What are you going to do?

394
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,507
Why do we stop now?

395
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:15,592
You gotta promise me
you're not gonna kill anyone, right?

396
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:18,265
- Right.
- Swear?

397
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:19,842
What?

398
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:23,020
Just put up your hand and say,
“I swear I won't kill anyone.”

399
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:26,937
I swear I will not kill anyone.

400
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:28,188
All right. Let's go.

401
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:37,193
Visiting hours is 10:00 to 4:00...

402
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:39,528
Monday through Friday.

403
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:44,457
What are you doing?

404
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:47,161
You son of a bitch!
You shot me!

405
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:50,252
Crazy bastard!

406
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:56,841
Don't shoot me again.
Don't kill me.

407
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:02,351
He'll live.

408
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:18,943
Son of a bitch!

409
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:21,741
Let's try to remain calm.

410
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:23,743
Open it, or he'll be dead
before he hits the floor.

411
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:25,871
There's no way, Connor.
Let him go.

412
00:58:25,961 --> 00:58:28,498
- Open the door.
- It ain't gonna happen.

413
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:30,420
Take it easy, Sarah.

414
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:33,625
It won't work. You're no killer.
I don't believe you can do it.

415
00:58:33,719 --> 00:58:36,677
You're already dead. Everybody dies.
You know I believe it.

416
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:38,800
So don't fuck with me!

417
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:40,597
Open the door!

418
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:49,057
Back off!

419
00:58:49,151 --> 00:58:50,562
Get back!

420
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:52,609
I'll pump him full of this shit.
I swear!

421
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,984
Don't move!

422
00:58:57,159 --> 00:58:58,320
Drop the shit!

423
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:00,276
Do it!

424
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,281
Get in the office.

425
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:04,409
On the floor, face down.
Not you!

426
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:06,160
Open the door.

427
00:59:09,046 --> 00:59:12,459
On the floor. Hold it open.
Face the wall!

428
00:59:28,482 --> 00:59:30,314
Get her!

429
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:01,003
Hurry up! Open the door!
The door's locked!

430
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:03,965
Let's go! Open it!

431
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:08,393
- She broke it off.
- Open it!

432
01:00:13,819 --> 01:00:16,151
Let's go around! Come on!
Move it!

433
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:49,392
Mom, wait!

434
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:57,226
Come back here!

435
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:03,483
- Help her!
- Wait here.

436
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:06,160
- Hurry up!
- He'll kill us all!

437
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:08,695
Hold her.

438
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:11,411
He'll kill us all!

439
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:35,939
Mom, are you okay? Mom!

440
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:42,817
Come with me
if you want to live.

441
01:01:42,908 --> 01:01:45,445
It's okay, Mom.
He's here to help.

442
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:11,178
Go.

443
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:46,043
What the fuck is it?
What the fuck is going on?

444
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,692
Get down.

445
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:40,184
Out of the car!

446
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:42,729
Right now!

447
01:04:07,218 --> 01:04:08,253
Go!

448
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:20,728
I'm out.

449
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,441
- Come on.
- Here.

450
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:34,067
Reload.

451
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:44,961
Last one!

452
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:53,762
Hang on.

453
01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:21,494
Ready!

454
01:05:35,223 --> 01:05:37,134
Here, drive.

455
01:06:30,361 --> 01:06:32,568
He's not back there.
There's nobody behind us.

456
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:34,737
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

457
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:38,237
Can you see anything?

458
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:40,743
I see everything.

459
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:45,241
Cool.

460
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:50,704
Come here.

461
01:06:56,513 --> 01:06:58,254
I said I was okay.

462
01:06:59,057 --> 01:07:02,220
John, it was stupid of you
to go there.

463
01:07:03,102 --> 01:07:05,434
You have to be smarter
than that.

464
01:07:05,522 --> 01:07:07,104
You were almost killed.

465
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:10,106
What were you thinking?

466
01:07:10,944 --> 01:07:13,527
You cannot risk yourself,
even for me.

467
01:07:13,613 --> 01:07:16,822
Do you understand?
You're too important.

468
01:07:16,908 --> 01:07:19,570
Do you understand?

469
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:23,570
But...

470
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:28,951
I had to get you out of that place.
I'm sorry.

471
01:07:30,213 --> 01:07:32,580
I didn't need your help.
I can take care of myself.

472
01:07:39,806 --> 01:07:41,422
What's wrong with your eyes?

473
01:07:43,393 --> 01:07:44,804
Nothing.

474
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:57,195
So, what's your story?

475
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:08,831
You okay?

476
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:10,329
Fine.

477
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:15,505
Say, that's a nice bike.

478
01:08:37,989 --> 01:08:39,696
Watch it, lug nuts.

479
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:50,619
Listen, do you know
what you're doing?

480
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:53,498
I have detailed files
on human anatomy.

481
01:08:54,422 --> 01:08:56,379
I bet.

482
01:08:56,466 --> 01:08:59,458
Makes you a more efficient killer,
right?

483
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:00,667
Correct.

484
01:09:06,726 --> 01:09:08,717
Does it hurt
when you get shot?

485
01:09:09,771 --> 01:09:13,230
I sense injuries.
The data could be called “pain.”

486
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:17,479
John, help me with the light.

487
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,857
- Will these heal up?
- Yes.

488
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:24,157
Good. If you can't pass for human,
you're not much good to us.

489
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:26,951
How long do you live?
I mean, last. Whatever.

490
01:09:27,038 --> 01:09:30,326
A hundred and twenty years
with my existing power cell.

491
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:33,329
Can you learn stuff that you
haven't been programmed with...

492
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:34,830
so you can be...

493
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:38,797
you know, more human...

494
01:09:38,883 --> 01:09:41,591
and not such a dork
all the time?

495
01:09:44,764 --> 01:09:48,302
My CPU is a neural net processor,
a learning computer.

496
01:09:48,393 --> 01:09:52,728
But Skynet presets the switch
to read-only when we're sent out alone.

497
01:09:54,107 --> 01:09:56,519
Doesn't want you to do
too much thinking, huh?

498
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:57,940
No.

499
01:09:59,487 --> 01:10:01,774
Can we reset the switch?

500
01:10:19,799 --> 01:10:24,259
Rotate the two locking cylinders
counterclockwise.

501
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:31,633
Do it.

502
01:10:39,944 --> 01:10:42,276
Now open the port cover.

503
01:10:44,824 --> 01:10:47,361
Pull to break the seal.

504
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:54,490
Good, now remove
the shock-damping assembly.

505
01:10:58,045 --> 01:11:01,208
You can now access the CPU.

506
01:11:01,299 --> 01:11:03,666
- Do you see it?
- Yes.

507
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:07,674
Hold the CPU by its base tab.

508
01:11:07,764 --> 01:11:09,175
Pull.

509
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:48,259
Do you see the pin switch?

510
01:11:48,346 --> 01:11:50,212
No! No!

511
01:11:51,224 --> 01:11:53,841
- Out of my way, John.
- Don't kill him.

512
01:11:53,935 --> 01:11:57,223
It, John, not him.
It.

513
01:11:57,313 --> 01:12:00,772
Okay, it.
But we need it.

514
01:12:00,858 --> 01:12:03,475
Listen to me.
You listen.

515
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:05,685
We're better off on our own.

516
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:07,566
But he's the only proof we have...

517
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:10,149
of the future and the war
and all that.

518
01:12:10,243 --> 01:12:11,608
Maybe.

519
01:12:14,247 --> 01:12:16,284
I don't trust it.

520
01:12:16,374 --> 01:12:18,081
But he's my friend, all right?

521
01:12:18,918 --> 01:12:21,660
You don't know what it's like
to try to kill one of these things...

522
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:25,338
and if something goes wrong
this could be our last chance, so move!

523
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:27,506
If I'm ever supposed to be
this great military leader...

524
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:31,427
maybe you should start listening
to my leadership ideas once in a while.

525
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:39,052
Because if my own mother won't,
how do you expect anyone else to?

526
01:12:53,286 --> 01:12:56,324
All right, play it your way.

527
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:05,833
Was there a problem?

528
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:07,413
No problem.

529
01:13:09,135 --> 01:13:10,341
None whatsoever.

530
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:45,914
Are we learning yet?

531
01:13:58,351 --> 01:14:01,309
We have to get as far away
from the city as possible.

532
01:14:05,024 --> 01:14:06,640
Just head south.

533
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:16,991
Keep it under 65.

534
01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:20,070
- We don't want to be pulled over.
- Affirmative.

535
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:25,784
You gotta listen to the way
people talk.

536
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:29,371
You don't say “affirmative”
or some shit like that.

537
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:31,797
You say, <i>“No problemo.”</i>

538
01:14:31,884 --> 01:14:35,798
If someone comes off to you
with an attitude, you say, “Eat me.”

539
01:14:35,888 --> 01:14:40,177
And if you want to shine them on,
it's “<i>Hasta la vista,</i> baby.”

540
01:14:43,396 --> 01:14:45,512
Yeah, or “Later, dick-wad.”

541
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:48,644
If someone gets upset,
you say, “Chill out.”

542
01:14:48,734 --> 01:14:50,099
Or you can do combinations.

543
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:53,190
Chill out, dick-wad.

544
01:14:54,031 --> 01:14:56,022
That's great.
See? You're getting it.

545
01:15:08,254 --> 01:15:10,120
You got any cash?

546
01:15:10,214 --> 01:15:13,752
I got a couple hundred bucks.
I'll give you half.

547
01:15:13,843 --> 01:15:15,504
Mom!

548
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:18,670
Get some food.

549
01:15:20,683 --> 01:15:23,095
No sense of humor.

550
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:32,108
That's another thing.
You can lighten up a bit yourself.

551
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:35,191
This severe routine
is getting old, okay.

552
01:15:35,281 --> 01:15:37,113
I mean, you're acting
like such a geek.

553
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:39,190
Smile once in a while.

554
01:15:39,285 --> 01:15:40,616
Smile?

555
01:15:40,703 --> 01:15:44,617
Yeah, you know, smile.
Watch.

556
01:15:45,624 --> 01:15:49,333
Hi. Nice place you got here.
How's business?

557
01:15:50,296 --> 01:15:52,128
Give me a break.

558
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:55,040
Okay, bad example.

559
01:15:56,177 --> 01:15:57,838
See that guy over there?

560
01:15:57,928 --> 01:15:59,794
That's a smile.

561
01:16:19,158 --> 01:16:20,614
That's good.

562
01:16:20,701 --> 01:16:23,659
Maybe you could practice
in front of a mirror or something.

563
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:32,831
Want some of my fries?

564
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:45,306
- Need any help?
- No.

565
01:16:46,727 --> 01:16:48,468
- I got you!
- No, you didn't!

566
01:16:56,821 --> 01:16:59,813
We're not gonna make it, are we?

567
01:17:01,867 --> 01:17:03,073
People, I mean.

568
01:17:06,247 --> 01:17:08,079
It's in your nature
to destroy yourselves.

569
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:12,079
Yeah. Major drag, huh?

570
01:17:12,169 --> 01:17:15,412
Break it up before I wring
both of your necks.

571
01:17:17,216 --> 01:17:20,299
I need to know
how Skynet gets built.

572
01:17:20,386 --> 01:17:21,626
Who's responsible?

573
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:25,258
The man most directly responsible
is Miles Bennett Dyson.

574
01:17:25,349 --> 01:17:27,056
Who is that?

575
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:31,057
He's the director of special projects
at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.

576
01:17:33,858 --> 01:17:35,599
Why him?

577
01:17:35,693 --> 01:17:39,061
In a few months, he creates
a revolutionary type of microprocessor.

578
01:17:40,114 --> 01:17:41,445
Go on. Then what?

579
01:17:42,575 --> 01:17:45,488
In three years Cyberdyne will become
the largest supplier...

580
01:17:45,578 --> 01:17:46,943
of military computer systems.

581
01:17:48,038 --> 01:17:50,951
All Stealth bombers are upgraded
with Cyberdyne computers...

582
01:17:51,041 --> 01:17:52,497
becoming fully unmanned.

583
01:17:52,585 --> 01:17:55,623
Afterwards they fly with
a perfect operational record.

584
01:17:55,713 --> 01:17:58,330
The Skynet funding bill is passed.

585
01:17:58,424 --> 01:18:01,712
The system goes on-line
on August 4, 1997.

586
01:18:01,802 --> 01:18:04,965
Human decisions are removed
from strategic defense.

587
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:07,763
Skynet begins to learn
at a geometric rate.

588
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:12,139
It becomes self-aware
at 2:14 a.m. Eastern time, August 29.

589
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:15,813
In a panic,
they try to pull the plug.

590
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:19,183
- Skynet fights back.
- Yes.

591
01:18:19,278 --> 01:18:22,020
It launches its missiles
against the targets in Russia.

592
01:18:22,114 --> 01:18:25,152
Why attack Russia?
Aren't they our friends now?

593
01:18:25,242 --> 01:18:29,611
Skynet knows the Russian counterattack
will eliminate its enemies over here.

594
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:31,787
Jesus.

595
01:18:33,959 --> 01:18:35,791
How much do you know
about Dyson?

596
01:18:38,047 --> 01:18:39,958
I have detailed files.

597
01:18:41,175 --> 01:18:43,132
I want to know everything.

598
01:18:44,345 --> 01:18:48,430
What he looks like,
where he lives, everything.

599
01:19:00,069 --> 01:19:01,480
Miles.

600
01:19:03,906 --> 01:19:05,863
<i>Miles.</i>

601
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:25,500
Are you going to work all day?

602
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:29,462
I'm sorry, baby.
But this thing is just kicking my ass.

603
01:19:29,556 --> 01:19:30,842
Miles, it's Sunday.

604
01:19:30,933 --> 01:19:33,675
You promised to take the kids
to Raging Waters today.

605
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:36,761
I can't...

606
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:39,146
I'm on a roll.

607
01:19:51,996 --> 01:19:54,203
Baby, this is going
to blow them all away.

608
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:57,373
- It's a neural net processor.
- I know. You told me.

609
01:19:57,459 --> 01:20:00,622
It's a neural net processor.
It thinks and learns like we do.

610
01:20:00,713 --> 01:20:03,375
It's superconducting
at room temperature.

611
01:20:03,465 --> 01:20:07,709
Other computers are just
pocket calculators by comparison.

612
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:11,879
But why is that
so goddamn important, Miles?

613
01:20:11,974 --> 01:20:13,305
I really need to know...

614
01:20:13,392 --> 01:20:16,475
because sometimes I feel
like I'm going crazy here.

615
01:20:18,147 --> 01:20:20,138
Baby, I am this close.

616
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:22,268
Come here.

617
01:20:24,903 --> 01:20:27,395
Imagine a jet airliner...

618
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:30,151
with a pilot that never gets tired,
never makes mistakes...

619
01:20:30,242 --> 01:20:32,108
never shows up to work
with a hangover.

620
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:36,908
Meet the pilot.

621
01:20:36,999 --> 01:20:40,082
Why did we get married, Miles?
Why did we have these children?

622
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:41,204
You don't need us.

623
01:20:41,295 --> 01:20:44,708
Your heart and your mind
are in here.

624
01:20:44,798 --> 01:20:47,665
But it doesn't love you
like we do.

625
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:58,468
I'm sorry. Really.

626
01:20:58,562 --> 01:21:02,806
How about spending some time
with your other babies?

627
01:21:05,486 --> 01:21:07,318
<i>Raging Waters!</i>

628
01:21:36,975 --> 01:21:38,932
Wait in the car.

629
01:22:17,141 --> 01:22:18,973
You're pretty jumpy, Connor.

630
01:22:39,746 --> 01:22:41,487
Hey, big John.

631
01:22:42,124 --> 01:22:43,239
What's up?

632
01:22:44,585 --> 01:22:46,826
He's cool, Enrique.
He's with me.

633
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:50,083
He's... Uncle Bob.

634
01:22:50,174 --> 01:22:52,381
Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.

635
01:22:52,468 --> 01:22:54,209
Uncle Bob, huh?

636
01:22:55,304 --> 01:22:56,544
Okay.

637
01:23:03,562 --> 01:23:04,597
Drink?

638
01:23:09,943 --> 01:23:11,354
“Uncle Bob”?

639
01:23:13,363 --> 01:23:16,151
You're pretty famous,
all over the goddamn TV.

640
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:18,903
Pictures of you, John,
your big friend here.

641
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:20,951
Cops are going nuts
looking for you.

642
01:23:24,875 --> 01:23:28,834
I just came for my stuff.
I need clothes, food and a truck.

643
01:23:28,921 --> 01:23:30,958
How about the fillings in my teeth?

644
01:23:31,048 --> 01:23:33,210
Now, Enrique.

645
01:23:34,551 --> 01:23:36,758
You two,
you're on weapons detail.

646
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:38,506
Let's go.

647
01:23:59,117 --> 01:24:01,028
One thing about my mom —

648
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:05,287
she always plans ahead.

649
01:24:15,968 --> 01:24:17,174
Excellent.

650
01:24:27,813 --> 01:24:31,477
This is my best truck,
but the starter motor's gone.

651
01:24:31,567 --> 01:24:33,478
You got time to change it out?

652
01:24:33,569 --> 01:24:36,903
Yeah. I'm gonna wait till dark
to cross the border.

653
01:24:36,989 --> 01:24:38,479
Enrique.

654
01:24:38,574 --> 01:24:42,192
It's dangerous for you here.
You get out tonight too, okay?

655
01:24:42,286 --> 01:24:44,744
Sure.

656
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:48,619
Just drop by anytime
and totally fuck up my life, all right?

657
01:24:53,046 --> 01:24:56,505
See, I grew up in places like this...

658
01:24:56,592 --> 01:24:59,004
so I just thought
that's how people lived —

659
01:25:00,345 --> 01:25:03,053
riding around in helicopters...

660
01:25:04,141 --> 01:25:06,348
learning how to blow shit up.

661
01:25:07,853 --> 01:25:10,515
But then when my mom got busted...

662
01:25:10,606 --> 01:25:12,973
I got put into a regular school.

663
01:25:13,650 --> 01:25:16,392
All the other kids
were into Nintendo.

664
01:25:30,667 --> 01:25:32,783
Are you ever afraid?

665
01:25:32,878 --> 01:25:34,164
No.

666
01:25:38,050 --> 01:25:39,836
Not even of dying?

667
01:25:40,385 --> 01:25:42,342
No.

668
01:25:46,683 --> 01:25:50,927
You don't feel any emotion about it,
one way or another?

669
01:25:51,021 --> 01:25:54,980
No. I have to stay functional
until my mission is complete.

670
01:25:59,988 --> 01:26:03,106
Then it doesn't matter.

671
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:06,909
I have to stay functional too.
“I'm too important.”

672
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:25,044
That's definitely you.

673
01:26:35,607 --> 01:26:39,066
Most of the guys my mom
hung around with were geeks...

674
01:26:39,444 --> 01:26:42,937
but there was this one guy,
he was kinda cool.

675
01:26:43,031 --> 01:26:44,942
He taught me engines.

676
01:26:45,033 --> 01:26:47,195
Hold here.

677
01:26:47,285 --> 01:26:49,697
Mom screwed it up, of course.

678
01:26:49,788 --> 01:26:52,200
She'd always tell 'em
about Judgment Day...

679
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:55,078
and me being this world leader.

680
01:26:55,168 --> 01:26:57,125
That'd be all she wrote.

681
01:26:58,463 --> 01:26:59,578
Torque wrench, please.

682
01:27:03,135 --> 01:27:06,344
I wish I could've met
my real dad.

683
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:08,171
You will.

684
01:27:08,265 --> 01:27:10,427
Yeah, I guess.

685
01:27:10,517 --> 01:27:14,351
When I'm, like, 45, I think.

686
01:27:14,438 --> 01:27:18,147
They sent him back through time
to 1984.

687
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:19,644
Man.

688
01:27:21,194 --> 01:27:23,652
He hasn't even been born yet.

689
01:27:25,449 --> 01:27:27,360
It messes with your head.

690
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:33,033
- The other bolt.
- Oh. Here.

691
01:27:39,379 --> 01:27:42,917
Mom and him were only together
for one night.

692
01:27:43,008 --> 01:27:45,466
She still loves him, I guess.

693
01:27:45,552 --> 01:27:48,419
I see her crying sometimes.

694
01:27:48,513 --> 01:27:52,507
She denies it totally, of course,
like she got something stuck in her eye.

695
01:27:57,481 --> 01:27:59,017
Why do you cry?

696
01:28:00,108 --> 01:28:01,598
- You mean people?
- Yeah.

697
01:28:01,693 --> 01:28:03,058
I don't know.

698
01:28:03,153 --> 01:28:05,235
We just cry...

699
01:28:05,322 --> 01:28:07,859
you know, when it hurts.

700
01:28:13,955 --> 01:28:15,696
Pain causes it?

701
01:28:16,792 --> 01:28:18,908
No. It's different.

702
01:28:19,002 --> 01:28:22,290
It's when there's nothing wrong
with you, but you hurt anyway.

703
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:23,962
- You get it?
- No.

704
01:28:25,217 --> 01:28:26,924
All right, my man!

705
01:28:28,762 --> 01:28:30,378
Give me five.

706
01:28:32,432 --> 01:28:34,548
Just put out your hand
like this.

707
01:28:35,894 --> 01:28:40,229
All right! Now hit me.
Give me five. Do the same thing.

708
01:28:44,945 --> 01:28:47,403
Okay, that's good.
Up high.

709
01:28:48,406 --> 01:28:49,646
Five low.

710
01:28:49,741 --> 01:28:51,402
Too slow.

711
01:28:54,412 --> 01:28:56,653
I'm just kidding.
One more time.

712
01:28:56,748 --> 01:28:58,955
Good. Now try it.

713
01:28:59,042 --> 01:29:00,999
Now do me.
Give me five.

714
01:29:02,462 --> 01:29:07,002
<i>Watching John with the machine,
it was suddenly so clear.</i>

715
01:29:07,092 --> 01:29:10,005
<i>The Terminator would never stop.</i>

716
01:29:10,095 --> 01:29:14,054
<i>It would never leave him,
never hurt him...</i>

717
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:17,553
<i>never shout at him
or get drunk and hit him...</i>

718
01:29:17,644 --> 01:29:20,227
<i>or be too busy
to spend time with him.</i>

719
01:29:21,106 --> 01:29:23,188
<i>It would always be there...</i>

720
01:29:23,275 --> 01:29:25,937
<i>and it would die
to protect him.</i>

721
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:30,696
<i>Of all the would-be fathers
who came and went over the years...</i>

722
01:29:30,782 --> 01:29:32,819
<i>this thing, this machine...</i>

723
01:29:32,909 --> 01:29:35,276
<i>was the only one
who measured up.</i>

724
01:29:36,037 --> 01:29:37,869
<i>In an insane world...</i>

725
01:29:37,956 --> 01:29:39,913
<i>it was the sanest choice.</i>

726
01:31:17,681 --> 01:31:19,638
Hey, let's try this one.

727
01:31:25,271 --> 01:31:27,433
There we go.

728
01:33:13,546 --> 01:33:16,038
She said go south with him
like you planned.

729
01:33:16,132 --> 01:33:18,339
- She'll meet you tomorrow.
- Mom!

730
01:33:20,136 --> 01:33:21,297
Mom, wait!

731
01:33:36,569 --> 01:33:38,025
“No fate.”

732
01:33:39,239 --> 01:33:41,697
No fate but what we make.

733
01:33:43,827 --> 01:33:45,818
My father told her this.

734
01:33:48,373 --> 01:33:52,662
I made him memorize it in the future
as a message to her.

735
01:33:54,337 --> 01:33:56,248
Never mind.

736
01:33:56,339 --> 01:33:59,673
Okay, the whole thing goes —

737
01:33:59,759 --> 01:34:02,467
The future's not set.

738
01:34:02,554 --> 01:34:06,047
There's no fate but what
we make for ourselves.

739
01:34:06,141 --> 01:34:09,133
She intends to change the future.

740
01:34:09,227 --> 01:34:10,683
Yeah, I guess.

741
01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:14,062
Oh, shit!

742
01:34:14,149 --> 01:34:16,060
- Dyson.
- Yeah.

743
01:34:16,151 --> 01:34:19,644
Gotta be. Miles Dyson.

744
01:34:19,737 --> 01:34:21,728
She's gonna blow him away.

745
01:34:21,823 --> 01:34:23,905
Come on! Let's go!

746
01:34:36,296 --> 01:34:38,333
This is tactically dangerous.

747
01:34:38,423 --> 01:34:39,538
Drive faster.

748
01:34:39,632 --> 01:34:42,124
The T-1000 has the same files
that I do.

749
01:34:42,218 --> 01:34:45,631
It knows what I know.
It might anticipate this move.

750
01:34:45,722 --> 01:34:48,214
I don't care.
We gotta stop her.

751
01:34:48,308 --> 01:34:50,219
Killing Dyson
might prevent the war.

752
01:34:50,310 --> 01:34:53,803
I don't care!
Haven't you learned anything yet?

753
01:34:53,897 --> 01:34:56,980
Haven't you figured out
why you can't kill people?

754
01:34:59,861 --> 01:35:02,353
Look, maybe you don't care
if you live or die...

755
01:35:02,447 --> 01:35:04,609
but everybody's not like that.

756
01:35:04,699 --> 01:35:08,283
We have feelings.
We hurt. We're afraid.

757
01:35:10,788 --> 01:35:14,452
You got to learn this stuff.
I'm not kidding. It's important.

758
01:35:52,121 --> 01:35:54,738
Danny, I told you to go to bed,
like your sister.

759
01:35:54,832 --> 01:35:58,200
Just a couple of minutes, Mom!

760
01:36:14,352 --> 01:36:16,684
Danny, your time is up!

761
01:36:16,771 --> 01:36:19,684
Come brush your teeth
and get to bed.

762
01:37:01,482 --> 01:37:02,813
Daddy!

763
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:05,392
Danny, go! Go!

764
01:37:13,369 --> 01:37:15,781
- Tarissa, run!
- Oh, my God!

765
01:37:22,879 --> 01:37:24,916
Just take Danny and run!

766
01:37:25,006 --> 01:37:26,246
Run!

767
01:37:26,341 --> 01:37:28,082
Oh, Jesus! Miles!

768
01:37:46,986 --> 01:37:47,976
Daddy!

769
01:37:49,697 --> 01:37:51,153
Nobody fucking move!

770
01:37:51,991 --> 01:37:53,231
Don't hurt my daddy!

771
01:37:53,326 --> 01:37:54,862
On the floor, bitch.

772
01:37:54,952 --> 01:37:57,114
Get down now!

773
01:37:57,997 --> 01:37:59,078
Get out of the way!

774
01:37:59,165 --> 01:38:00,621
Don't hurt him!

775
01:38:02,126 --> 01:38:04,117
Get on the floor now!

776
01:38:07,173 --> 01:38:08,880
Just let the boy go.

777
01:38:08,966 --> 01:38:10,548
Shut up. Shut up.

778
01:38:10,635 --> 01:38:11,921
Shut up!

779
01:38:12,011 --> 01:38:14,594
It's all your fault, motherfucker.

780
01:38:14,680 --> 01:38:16,921
- It's all your fault!
- What?

781
01:38:17,016 --> 01:38:19,132
I'm not gonna let you do it.

782
01:39:11,154 --> 01:39:13,236
Shit! We're too late!

783
01:39:17,743 --> 01:39:18,858
Check them.

784
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:24,531
Look at me, Mom.

785
01:39:24,625 --> 01:39:26,832
Are you hurt?

786
01:39:30,465 --> 01:39:32,547
I almost —

787
01:39:44,187 --> 01:39:46,519
It'll be okay.

788
01:39:46,606 --> 01:39:48,563
We'll figure something out.
Okay?

789
01:39:50,151 --> 01:39:51,767
I promise.

790
01:39:55,072 --> 01:39:58,030
You came here to stop me.

791
01:39:58,910 --> 01:40:00,867
Yeah, I did.

792
01:40:03,748 --> 01:40:05,739
I love you, John.

793
01:40:07,418 --> 01:40:09,000
I always have.

794
01:40:10,922 --> 01:40:12,333
I know.

795
01:40:19,347 --> 01:40:21,554
Deep penetration.

796
01:40:23,142 --> 01:40:25,053
No shattered bone.

797
01:40:25,144 --> 01:40:28,102
Hold here.
The pressure should stop the bleeding.

798
01:40:38,866 --> 01:40:40,277
Who are you people?

799
01:40:41,244 --> 01:40:42,655
Show him.

800
01:40:45,331 --> 01:40:49,495
Danny, I want you to come with me
right now. Show me your room.

801
01:41:30,001 --> 01:41:31,207
Oh, my God.

802
01:41:31,294 --> 01:41:33,956
Now listen to me
very carefully.

803
01:41:39,844 --> 01:41:43,963
<i>Dyson listened while the Terminator
laid it all down.</i>

804
01:41:44,056 --> 01:41:47,924
<i>Skynet. Judgment Day.</i>

805
01:41:48,019 --> 01:41:50,306
<i>The history of things to come.</i>

806
01:41:51,731 --> 01:41:54,473
<i>It's not every day that
you find out you're responsible...</i>

807
01:41:54,567 --> 01:41:57,400
<i>for three billion deaths.</i>

808
01:41:57,486 --> 01:41:59,397
<i>He took it pretty well.</i>

809
01:42:01,407 --> 01:42:03,865
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

810
01:42:09,874 --> 01:42:11,990
You're judging me...

811
01:42:12,084 --> 01:42:14,542
on things I haven't even done yet.

812
01:42:18,758 --> 01:42:20,874
How were we supposed to know?

813
01:42:23,346 --> 01:42:25,303
Yeah.

814
01:42:25,389 --> 01:42:27,756
Right.

815
01:42:27,850 --> 01:42:29,966
How were you supposed to know?

816
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:34,729
Fucking men like you
built the hydrogen bomb.

817
01:42:34,815 --> 01:42:37,398
Men like you...

818
01:42:37,485 --> 01:42:38,896
thought it up.

819
01:42:42,782 --> 01:42:44,739
You think you're so creative.

820
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:49,243
You don't know what it's like
to really create something...

821
01:42:49,330 --> 01:42:51,446
to create a life...

822
01:42:51,540 --> 01:42:53,076
to feel it growing inside you.

823
01:42:53,167 --> 01:42:56,080
All you know how to create
is death and destruction.

824
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:57,831
Mom!

825
01:42:57,922 --> 01:43:01,665
We need to be a little more
constructive here. Okay?

826
01:43:01,759 --> 01:43:03,841
We still have to stop this
from happening, don't we?

827
01:43:03,928 --> 01:43:06,761
But I thought —

828
01:43:06,847 --> 01:43:10,841
Aren't we changing things right now,
changing the way it goes?

829
01:43:10,935 --> 01:43:15,725
That's right. There's no way I'm going
to finish the new processor. Not now.

830
01:43:15,815 --> 01:43:19,274
Forget it. I'm out of it.
I'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.

831
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:21,226
That's not good enough.

832
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:23,231
No one must follow your work.

833
01:43:23,322 --> 01:43:25,188
Right.

834
01:43:25,282 --> 01:43:29,617
All right, then we have to destroy
all the stuff at the lab —

835
01:43:29,704 --> 01:43:31,286
the files, the disk drives...

836
01:43:31,372 --> 01:43:33,989
everything here.

837
01:43:34,083 --> 01:43:36,165
Everything.

838
01:43:36,252 --> 01:43:38,163
I don't care.

839
01:43:39,463 --> 01:43:40,453
The chip.

840
01:43:40,548 --> 01:43:42,630
- Do you know about the chip?
- What chip?

841
01:43:42,717 --> 01:43:45,129
It's at Cyberdyne.
It's from the other one like you.

842
01:43:45,219 --> 01:43:47,927
The CPU from the first Terminator.

843
01:43:48,013 --> 01:43:50,380
Son of a bitch!
I knew it!

844
01:43:50,474 --> 01:43:53,182
They told us not to ask
where they got it.

845
01:43:53,269 --> 01:43:55,601
Those lying motherfuckers.

846
01:43:55,688 --> 01:43:57,474
It's scary stuff.
Radically advanced.

847
01:43:57,565 --> 01:43:58,680
It was smashed.

848
01:43:58,774 --> 01:44:02,392
It didn't work, but it gave us ideas,
took us in new directions.

849
01:44:02,486 --> 01:44:04,477
Things we would've never —

850
01:44:06,657 --> 01:44:08,739
All my work was based on it.

851
01:44:08,826 --> 01:44:10,658
It must be destroyed.

852
01:44:12,913 --> 01:44:15,905
Can you get us in?
Past security?

853
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,082
I think so, yeah. When?

854
01:44:23,007 --> 01:44:23,997
Now?

855
01:44:27,928 --> 01:44:30,966
<i>The future,
always so clear to me...</i>

856
01:44:31,056 --> 01:44:34,048
<i>had become like
a black highway at night.</i>

857
01:44:34,143 --> 01:44:36,851
<i>We were in
uncharted territory now...</i>

858
01:44:36,937 --> 01:44:39,850
<i>making up history
as we went along.</i>

859
01:45:18,187 --> 01:45:20,098
Carl, right?

860
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:24,853
Friends from out of town.
I just thought I'd...

861
01:45:24,944 --> 01:45:26,935
take 'em upstairs
and show 'em around.

862
01:45:27,029 --> 01:45:30,317
Mr. Dyson, you know the rules
concerning visitors in the lab.

863
01:45:30,407 --> 01:45:32,569
I need written authorization —

864
01:45:33,619 --> 01:45:35,610
I insist.

865
01:45:35,704 --> 01:45:37,445
Don't even think about it.

866
01:45:48,425 --> 01:45:49,881
It's okay.

867
01:45:51,303 --> 01:45:54,421
It takes two keys, turned
simultaneously, to open the vault.

868
01:45:54,515 --> 01:45:57,428
The other one is in a locker
at the security station.

869
01:45:58,769 --> 01:46:00,225
Gibbons?

870
01:46:03,274 --> 01:46:05,106
Gibbons! Come on, man!

871
01:46:05,192 --> 01:46:08,275
You can't leave the desk
like that!

872
01:46:13,117 --> 01:46:14,607
Oh, shit.

873
01:46:32,177 --> 01:46:34,168
My card should access this.

874
01:46:38,851 --> 01:46:41,263
- What is it?
- Damn it.

875
01:46:41,353 --> 01:46:43,310
The silent alarm's been tripped.

876
01:46:49,486 --> 01:46:52,228
It's neutralized all the codes
in the entire building.

877
01:46:52,323 --> 01:46:54,234
Nothing will open anywhere now.

878
01:46:55,326 --> 01:46:57,158
We have to abort.

879
01:47:00,372 --> 01:47:03,785
We go all the way.
Okay?

880
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:09,709
You guys get started on the lab.
I can open this.

881
01:47:09,798 --> 01:47:12,256
- I think it's that guy from the mall.
- It is.

882
01:47:12,343 --> 01:47:14,254
It's him and the woman.

883
01:47:15,846 --> 01:47:19,009
Just send everything
you got in the area right now.

884
01:47:21,226 --> 01:47:24,685
I have a personal entry code
for the lab. It may still work.

885
01:47:29,193 --> 01:47:30,228
It's no good.

886
01:47:30,319 --> 01:47:31,855
Let me try mine.

887
01:47:36,825 --> 01:47:38,907
John, fire in the hole!

888
01:47:50,965 --> 01:47:55,755
Wait! You can't go in there.
The fire set off the Halon system.

889
01:48:02,935 --> 01:48:05,393
You have to wait
until the gas clears.

890
01:48:07,898 --> 01:48:09,184
Put this on.

891
01:48:23,163 --> 01:48:25,655
All right, let's get to work.

892
01:48:46,854 --> 01:48:50,142
<i>All units in the vicinity
and all units able to respond...</i>

893
01:48:50,232 --> 01:48:55,022
<i>a 211 in progress, 2144 Kramer Street,
the Cyberdyne building.</i>

894
01:48:55,112 --> 01:48:56,773
<i>Suspect one is white female...</i>

895
01:48:56,864 --> 01:49:00,323
<i>identified as last name Connor,
first name Sarah.</i>

896
01:49:00,409 --> 01:49:03,322
<i>Escaped last night
from Pescadero State Hospital.</i>

897
01:49:03,412 --> 01:49:05,278
<i>Suspect two: White male...</i>

898
01:49:09,043 --> 01:49:11,159
All the disks in my office...

899
01:49:11,253 --> 01:49:13,369
all the disks
in that office over there...

900
01:49:13,464 --> 01:49:15,455
everything behind my desk...

901
01:49:15,549 --> 01:49:17,790
and all the processors
on my left.

902
01:49:17,885 --> 01:49:20,468
We'll blow those with the C4.

903
01:49:34,068 --> 01:49:36,105
Can I —

904
01:49:36,195 --> 01:49:37,981
Excuse me.

905
01:49:39,656 --> 01:49:42,273
Can I borrow that thing?

906
01:49:51,418 --> 01:49:53,705
I worked a lot of years on this thing.

907
01:49:57,883 --> 01:49:59,920
<i>One-Mary-23,
give me that location again.</i>

908
01:50:00,010 --> 01:50:01,751
<i>2111 Kramer.</i>

909
01:50:01,845 --> 01:50:04,963
<i>Suspects are armed and
considered extremely dangerous.</i>

910
01:50:57,234 --> 01:50:59,020
All right.

911
01:50:59,111 --> 01:51:00,897
7-2-5-6.

912
01:51:07,744 --> 01:51:09,075
Easy money.

913
01:51:18,172 --> 01:51:20,584
Oh, shit. Not good.

914
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:27,295
How we doing?

915
01:51:27,389 --> 01:51:29,050
Primer cord is set.

916
01:51:29,141 --> 01:51:31,599
One more barrel,
two more minutes.

917
01:51:35,480 --> 01:51:38,393
- How do we set them off?
- Remote control.

918
01:51:38,483 --> 01:51:40,850
Piece of cake.

919
01:51:40,944 --> 01:51:42,480
- We got company.
- Police?

920
01:51:42,571 --> 01:51:45,905
- How many?
- All of 'em, I think.

921
01:51:45,991 --> 01:51:47,402
Go. I'll finish here.

922
01:51:49,369 --> 01:51:50,780
Come on.

923
01:51:51,872 --> 01:51:53,783
I'll take care of the police.

924
01:51:53,874 --> 01:51:55,160
Wait! You swore!

925
01:51:58,128 --> 01:51:59,584
Trust me.

926
01:52:12,851 --> 01:52:14,467
<i>You at the window!</i>

927
01:52:14,561 --> 01:52:18,020
<i>Drop your weapon and place
your hands on top of your head!</i>

928
01:52:19,358 --> 01:52:21,190
Holy shit!

929
01:52:21,276 --> 01:52:22,812
That's a mini-gun!

930
01:52:45,050 --> 01:52:47,382
- Come on!
- Oh, shit!

931
01:52:47,469 --> 01:52:49,005
Go! Go! Go!

932
01:53:36,601 --> 01:53:38,057
Fire!

933
01:53:55,412 --> 01:53:57,028
Same time, to the left.

934
01:53:57,122 --> 01:53:59,454
One, two, three, go.

935
01:54:11,595 --> 01:54:14,428
In order to get that out —

936
01:54:21,229 --> 01:54:23,971
We got Skynet by the balls now.

937
01:54:24,066 --> 01:54:25,773
Come on, let's book.

938
01:54:26,693 --> 01:54:28,604
Hold your fire!

939
01:54:53,804 --> 01:54:56,296
- Ready to rock?
- Ready.

940
01:54:59,059 --> 01:55:00,345
Time to go.

941
01:55:00,435 --> 01:55:01,891
Now.

942
01:55:01,978 --> 01:55:05,516
- Take this. They'll use gas.
- Come on.

943
01:55:05,607 --> 01:55:08,690
Get started on the door.
Miles, hand me the detonator.

944
01:55:32,968 --> 01:55:35,710
Mom! Mom!

945
01:56:20,098 --> 01:56:21,213
Shit!

946
01:56:22,642 --> 01:56:25,555
She's in the clean room.
There's no way outta there.

947
01:56:35,071 --> 01:56:36,061
Get down!

948
01:56:43,580 --> 01:56:44,991
Here.

949
01:57:10,524 --> 01:57:13,937
I don't know how much longer
I can hold this.

950
01:57:18,114 --> 01:57:19,604
Fall back!

951
01:57:19,699 --> 01:57:21,281
Everybody out!

952
01:57:21,368 --> 01:57:23,279
Fall back now!
Go! Go! Go!

953
01:57:58,697 --> 01:58:00,654
<i>We got a war zone here!</i>

954
01:58:32,564 --> 01:58:34,271
Shut your eyes.

955
01:58:40,864 --> 01:58:44,027
Stay here. I'll be back.

956
01:58:51,875 --> 01:58:54,207
Get down on the floor!
Face down!

957
01:58:56,921 --> 01:58:58,503
On the floor now!

958
01:59:00,842 --> 01:59:02,332
Okay, drop him!

959
02:00:22,215 --> 02:00:23,626
Here, hold this.

960
02:00:57,041 --> 02:00:58,031
Go!

961
02:01:36,998 --> 02:01:37,908
Shit!

962
02:01:51,513 --> 02:01:53,220
Get out.

963
02:02:12,242 --> 02:02:13,528
Listen.

964
02:02:13,618 --> 02:02:16,326
No matter what happens,
stay under these vests.

965
02:02:16,412 --> 02:02:17,652
- You got it?
- Yeah.

966
02:02:17,747 --> 02:02:19,203
All right.

967
02:02:33,763 --> 02:02:35,003
Chopper's coming in!

968
02:02:35,098 --> 02:02:36,213
It's him.

969
02:03:33,990 --> 02:03:35,321
Shit!

970
02:03:38,202 --> 02:03:39,988
Stay down!

971
02:04:54,278 --> 02:04:56,736
Goddamn! You all right?

972
02:05:04,247 --> 02:05:06,659
Come on, Mom,
we gotta get out.

973
02:05:08,584 --> 02:05:10,200
Take the shotgun.

974
02:05:13,464 --> 02:05:15,046
Are you hurt?

975
02:05:28,229 --> 02:05:31,142
Holy shit.
Come on, Mom. Come on!

976
02:05:31,232 --> 02:05:33,940
- We need your truck.
- Hurry!

977
02:05:38,948 --> 02:05:41,440
- Come on. Hurry.
- Get in.

978
02:05:44,454 --> 02:05:45,660
Go!

979
02:05:51,669 --> 02:05:53,660
What the hell —

980
02:05:59,552 --> 02:06:02,294
- I'm bleeding bad.
- Keep pressure on it.

981
02:06:03,973 --> 02:06:05,634
Here. This'll work.

982
02:06:11,230 --> 02:06:12,937
He's gaining.

983
02:06:15,485 --> 02:06:17,146
Step on it!

984
02:06:17,236 --> 02:06:20,024
- This is the vehicle's top speed.
- I can run faster than this!

985
02:06:30,875 --> 02:06:32,331
Coming up, to the right.

986
02:06:34,378 --> 02:06:36,335
Watch it! Watch it!

987
02:06:58,903 --> 02:07:01,019
- Drive.
- Where are you going?

988
02:07:08,496 --> 02:07:10,407
Take the off-ramp.

989
02:07:20,091 --> 02:07:21,252
Shit!

990
02:07:24,428 --> 02:07:25,509
Hold on!

991
02:08:11,350 --> 02:08:12,966
Don't stop!

992
02:08:20,818 --> 02:08:22,229
Go straight!

993
02:08:24,864 --> 02:08:27,151
- Look out!
- Duck!

994
02:08:41,297 --> 02:08:43,254
Get the hell outta here!

995
02:08:48,763 --> 02:08:51,801
Get outta here!
Let's go! Come on!

996
02:10:08,801 --> 02:10:11,259
<i>Hasta la vista,</i> baby.

997
02:11:00,853 --> 02:11:02,264
We don't have much time.

998
02:11:24,877 --> 02:11:26,117
Let's go.

999
02:11:27,213 --> 02:11:28,999
We gotta get outta here.

1000
02:11:29,090 --> 02:11:31,172
Come on! Get up!

1001
02:11:44,772 --> 02:11:46,479
Hand me the shotgun.

1002
02:11:51,320 --> 02:11:53,607
Put your weight on me, Mom.

1003
02:11:54,407 --> 02:11:56,318
Hurry!

1004
02:11:59,870 --> 02:12:01,486
Come on, Mom.

1005
02:12:08,003 --> 02:12:09,334
Get up!

1006
02:12:40,870 --> 02:12:42,827
This way. Come on.

1007
02:13:09,857 --> 02:13:11,518
No! Wait!

1008
02:13:11,817 --> 02:13:15,731
Wait. No. No.
It's too hot. Go back.

1009
02:13:23,954 --> 02:13:26,195
- Go. Run.
- No! We gotta stick together.

1010
02:13:26,290 --> 02:13:28,281
John, you've got to go now.

1011
02:13:28,375 --> 02:13:30,537
- John!
- Go! Now!

1012
02:14:44,994 --> 02:14:46,780
Get up the steps.

1013
02:14:54,169 --> 02:14:55,659
Get up.

1014
02:14:56,463 --> 02:14:58,625
Come on, Mom.
I got you.

1015
02:15:33,042 --> 02:15:35,374
Grab the chain. Grab it.

1016
02:15:36,754 --> 02:15:39,496
Grab it. Go. Go!

1017
02:15:49,850 --> 02:15:53,184
Mom, come on! Mom!

1018
02:16:42,319 --> 02:16:44,105
Call to John.

1019
02:16:46,907 --> 02:16:48,773
I know this hurts.

1020
02:16:50,577 --> 02:16:52,238
Call John.

1021
02:17:08,637 --> 02:17:11,299
Call to John now.

1022
02:17:13,308 --> 02:17:15,174
Fuck you.

1023
02:20:32,716 --> 02:20:34,172
Help!

1024
02:20:54,821 --> 02:20:56,403
Mom.

1025
02:21:01,620 --> 02:21:03,987
- Help me.
- Get out of the way, John.

1026
02:21:04,957 --> 02:21:07,198
- John! John!
- Shoot!

1027
02:22:03,223 --> 02:22:05,635
Get down!

1028
02:23:38,944 --> 02:23:41,106
Get up. Come on.

1029
02:23:43,365 --> 02:23:45,151
Holy shit.

1030
02:23:45,242 --> 02:23:47,700
I need a vacation.

1031
02:24:00,924 --> 02:24:03,712
Is it dead?

1032
02:24:03,802 --> 02:24:05,213
Terminated.

1033
02:24:08,723 --> 02:24:10,384
Will this melt in there?

1034
02:24:13,353 --> 02:24:15,219
Yes. Throw it in.

1035
02:24:22,320 --> 02:24:24,231
And the chip.

1036
02:24:39,421 --> 02:24:41,037
It's over.

1037
02:24:47,888 --> 02:24:49,549
There's one more chip.

1038
02:24:54,227 --> 02:24:56,468
And it must be destroyed also.

1039
02:25:01,943 --> 02:25:03,525
Here.

1040
02:25:03,612 --> 02:25:06,980
I cannot self-terminate.
You must lower me into the steel.

1041
02:25:20,128 --> 02:25:22,586
I'm sorry, John. I'm sorry.

1042
02:25:22,672 --> 02:25:24,959
No, it'll be okay.
Stay with us.

1043
02:25:25,050 --> 02:25:27,041
- It'll be okay.
- I have to go away.

1044
02:25:27,135 --> 02:25:29,718
No, don't do it.
Please, don't go.

1045
02:25:29,804 --> 02:25:32,887
I must go away, John.

1046
02:25:32,974 --> 02:25:34,430
No, wait.

1047
02:25:34,517 --> 02:25:37,430
- You don't have to do this.
- I'm sorry.

1048
02:25:38,355 --> 02:25:40,596
No, don't do it! Don't go!

1049
02:25:40,690 --> 02:25:42,647
It has to end here.

1050
02:25:43,860 --> 02:25:47,148
I order you not to go!

1051
02:25:55,121 --> 02:25:57,158
I know now why you cry.

1052
02:25:59,542 --> 02:26:02,000
But it's something
I can never do.

1053
02:26:36,329 --> 02:26:38,536
Good-bye.

1054
02:28:17,597 --> 02:28:20,635
<i>The unknown future
rolls toward us.</i>

1055
02:28:20,725 --> 02:28:24,639
<i>I face it for the first time
with a sense of hope.</i>

1056
02:28:24,729 --> 02:28:27,061
<i>Because if a machine,
a Terminator...</i>

1057
02:28:27,148 --> 02:28:30,482
