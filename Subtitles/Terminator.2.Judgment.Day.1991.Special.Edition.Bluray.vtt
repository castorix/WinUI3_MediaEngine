00:01:18.328 --> 00:01:24.199
<i>Three billion human lives ended
on August 29, 1997.</i>

00:01:24.293 --> 00:01:26.409
<i>The survivors of the nuclear fire...</i>

00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:29.211
<i>called the war “Judgment Day.”</i>

00:01:29.298 --> 00:01:32.381
<i>They lived only to face
a new nightmare —</i>

00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:34.504
<i>the war against the machines.</i>

00:02:52.673 --> 00:02:56.416
<i>The computer which controlled
the machines, Skynet...</i>

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.502
<i>sent two Terminators
back through time.</i>

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:03.635
<i>Their mission: to destroy the leader
of the human resistance.</i>

00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:06.558
<i>John Connor, my son.</i>

00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:14.851
<i>The first Terminator was programmed
to strike at me in the year 1984...</i>

00:03:14.945 --> 00:03:17.277
<i>before john was born.</i>

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:19.196
<i>It failed.</i>

00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:22.115
<i>The second was set to strike
at John himself...</i>

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:24.660
<i>when he was still a child.</i>

00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:32.080
<i>As before, the resistance was able
to send a lone warrior...</i>

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.457
<i>a protector for john.</i>

00:03:34.548 --> 00:03:37.961
<i>It was just a question of which one
of them would reach him first.</i>

00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:56.090
I need your clothes, your boots
and your motorcycle.

00:08:04.609 --> 00:08:07.067
You forgot to say please.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.127
Get him off me!

00:08:45.984 --> 00:08:47.224
Pull it out!

00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:09.963
Take it.

00:09:35.784 --> 00:09:38.401
Can't let you take
the man's wheels, son.

00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:41.988
Now, get off
before I put you down.

00:09:50.882 --> 00:09:53.294
That's it, goddamn it.

00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:56.103
R-31 David, Sherman Code 6...

00:10:56.197 --> 00:11:00.907
at the Sixth Street Bridge and Santa Fe
on electrical disturbance.

00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:03.235
<i>Ten-four, R-31 David.</i>

00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:43.089
John, get in there and clean up
that pigsty of yours.

00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:57.061
Your foster parents
are kind of dicks, huh?

00:12:57.151 --> 00:13:00.234
I swear, I have had it
with that goddamn kid.

00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:02.938
- He won't even answer me anymore.
- Honey, move.

00:13:03.032 --> 00:13:05.945
Would you get off your butt
and help me?

00:13:06.035 --> 00:13:08.868
- Todd!
- What?

00:13:08.955 --> 00:13:12.289
He hasn't cleaned that room of his
in a month.

00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:15.538
Oh, it's an emergency.
Hang on. I'll get right on it.

00:13:22.593 --> 00:13:24.459
Come on.

00:13:25.305 --> 00:13:28.593
Get your ass inside.
Do what your mother tells you.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.558
She's not my mother, Todd.

00:13:58.755 --> 00:14:00.746
<i>This next patient is interesting.</i>

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.298
I've been following the case
for years.

00:14:03.384 --> 00:14:05.466
A 29-year-old female...

00:14:07.805 --> 00:14:10.467
diagnosed as acute
schizo-affective disorder.

00:14:10.558 --> 00:14:13.801
The usual indicators: depression,
anxiety, violent acting out...

00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:15.602
delusions of persecution.

00:14:22.028 --> 00:14:25.396
<i>The delusional architecture
is fairly unique.</i>

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:28.323
She believes that a machine
called the Terminator...

00:14:28.409 --> 00:14:31.743
which looks human,
was sent back through time...

00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:33.866
- to kill her.
- That's original.

00:14:33.956 --> 00:14:37.199
And also that the father
of her child...

00:14:37.293 --> 00:14:40.536
was a soldier sent back
to protect her.

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:42.541
He was from the future too.

00:14:42.632 --> 00:14:47.251
The year 2029,
if I remember correctly.

00:14:47.345 --> 00:14:49.586
And here we are.

00:14:50.348 --> 00:14:51.463
<i>Morning, Sarah.</i>

00:14:55.812 --> 00:14:59.771
Good morning, Dr. Silberman.
How's the knee?

00:15:01.609 --> 00:15:03.520
<i>Fine, Sarah.</i>

00:15:04.654 --> 00:15:06.895
She stabbed me in the kneecap...

00:15:06.989 --> 00:15:10.527
with my pen a few weeks ago.

00:15:10.618 --> 00:15:12.108
Repeated escape attempts.

00:15:22.422 --> 00:15:24.629
Let's move on, shall we?

00:15:24.715 --> 00:15:28.049
I don't like to see the patients
disrupting their rooms like this.

00:15:28.136 --> 00:15:31.504
- See she takes her Thorazine.
- Sure. I'll take care of it.

00:15:44.235 --> 00:15:47.318
It's time to take your meds, Connor.

00:15:47.405 --> 00:15:49.146
You take it.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:52.574
Now you know you gotta be good.
You're up for review this afternoon.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.571
I'm not taking it, Dougie.

00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:57.700
- I don't want any trouble.
- Ain't no trouble.

00:16:03.754 --> 00:16:05.040
Zap her.

00:16:15.641 --> 00:16:17.632
Last call, sugar.

00:16:23.649 --> 00:16:25.640
Sweet dreams.

00:16:55.264 --> 00:16:57.255
Are you the legal guardian
of John Connor?

00:16:57.558 --> 00:17:01.017
That's right, Officer.
What's he done now?

00:17:01.103 --> 00:17:04.061
- Could I speak with him, please?
- You could if he were here.

00:17:04.148 --> 00:17:07.015
He took off on his bike this morning.
He could be anywhere.

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:09.396
Do you have a photograph of John?

00:17:09.487 --> 00:17:10.727
Yeah. Hold on.

00:17:13.282 --> 00:17:15.899
Gonna tell me what this is about?

00:17:15.993 --> 00:17:18.576
I just need to ask him
a few questions.

00:17:19.747 --> 00:17:23.536
He's a good-looking boy.
Do you mind if I keep this picture?

00:17:23.626 --> 00:17:27.119
No, go on. There was a guy here
this morning looking for him too.

00:17:27.213 --> 00:17:29.375
Yeah, a big guy on a bike.

00:17:29.465 --> 00:17:31.923
Has that got something
to do with this?

00:17:35.263 --> 00:17:38.346
I wouldn't worry about him.

00:17:38.432 --> 00:17:41.220
Thanks for your cooperation.

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:45.262
Please insert your stolen card now.

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:54.271
PIN number.

00:17:55.491 --> 00:17:57.073
Hurry up. This is taking too long.

00:17:57.159 --> 00:17:58.649
Go, baby.

00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:01.702
All right.

00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:05.498
- PIN number 9003.
- Where'd you learn this stuff from?

00:18:05.585 --> 00:18:08.077
From my mom.
My real mom, I mean.

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:12.414
Withdraw 300 bucks.

00:18:12.508 --> 00:18:15.250
Come on, baby. Come on!

00:18:15.344 --> 00:18:17.585
- Yes!
- Hey, it worked.

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:21.344
All right. Easy money.
Come on!

00:18:23.853 --> 00:18:25.969
Yes! Piece of cake.

00:18:31.235 --> 00:18:34.353
- Is that her?
- Yes.

00:18:34.447 --> 00:18:36.279
She's pretty cool, huh?

00:18:36.365 --> 00:18:38.606
No, she's a complete psycho.

00:18:38.701 --> 00:18:41.443
That's why she's at Pescadero.
It's a mental institute.

00:18:43.205 --> 00:18:46.197
She tried to blow up a computer factory
but got shot and arrested.

00:18:46.292 --> 00:18:48.374
No shit.

00:18:49.086 --> 00:18:51.453
She's a total loser.

00:18:51.547 --> 00:18:54.289
Come on.
Let's go spend some money.

00:19:23.079 --> 00:19:25.286
Sarah, wake up.

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:34.087
Kyle.

00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:38.128
You're dead.

00:19:38.219 --> 00:19:40.256
Where's our son, Sarah?

00:19:41.263 --> 00:19:43.504
They took him away from me.

00:19:43.599 --> 00:19:46.808
- He's the target now.
- I know.

00:19:46.894 --> 00:19:48.931
He's all alone.
You have to protect him.

00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:51.479
I know.

00:19:51.565 --> 00:19:54.148
You tell me
how I'm supposed to do that.

00:19:54.235 --> 00:19:56.351
He doesn't even believe me anymore.

00:19:56.445 --> 00:20:00.484
- I've lost him.
- You're strong, Sarah.

00:20:00.574 --> 00:20:02.986
Stronger than you ever thought
you could be.

00:20:04.036 --> 00:20:05.447
On your feet, soldier!

00:20:07.581 --> 00:20:10.369
I love you, Sarah.
I always will.

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:15.583
- I need you.
- I'll always be with you.

00:20:19.468 --> 00:20:22.961
Remember the message?

00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:24.841
The future is not set.

00:20:26.016 --> 00:20:29.600
There is no fate
but what we make for ourselves.

00:20:49.582 --> 00:20:51.493
Stay with me.

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:55.327
There's not much time left
in the world, Sarah.

00:21:02.511 --> 00:21:04.627
Kyle, don't go!

00:22:30.307 --> 00:22:34.266
<i>It's like a giant strobe light...</i>

00:22:34.353 --> 00:22:36.685
<i>burning right through my eyes.</i>

00:22:40.693 --> 00:22:43.185
<i>Somehow I can still see.</i>

00:22:49.076 --> 00:22:50.987
<i>Oh, God.</i>

00:22:54.331 --> 00:22:57.790
<i>We know the dream's the same
every night.</i>

00:22:57.877 --> 00:23:01.290
<i>- Why do I have to —
- Please continue.</i>

00:23:04.967 --> 00:23:07.709
<i>Children look like burnt paper.</i>

00:23:09.346 --> 00:23:11.462
<i>Black.</i>

00:23:11.557 --> 00:23:13.468
<i>Not moving.</i>

00:23:15.311 --> 00:23:17.723
<i>And then the blast wave hits them.</i>

00:23:27.031 --> 00:23:29.739
<i>And they fly apart like leaves.</i>

00:23:31.493 --> 00:23:34.861
<i>Dreams of cataclysm,
the end of the world...</i>

00:23:34.955 --> 00:23:36.866
<i>are very common.</i>

00:23:38.584 --> 00:23:42.828
<i>It's not a dream, you moron.
It's real.</i>

00:23:42.922 --> 00:23:46.836
<i>- I know the date it happens.
- I'm sure it feels real to you.</i>

00:23:46.926 --> 00:23:49.418
<i>On August 29, 1997...</i>

00:23:49.511 --> 00:23:53.004
<i>it's gonna feel
pretty fuckin' real to you too!</i>

00:23:53.098 --> 00:23:56.762
<i>Anybody not wearing two-million
sunblock is gonna have a real bad day.</i>

00:23:56.852 --> 00:23:58.763
<i>Get it?</i>

00:23:58.854 --> 00:24:01.721
<i>God, you think
you're safe and alive.</i>

00:24:01.815 --> 00:24:04.102
<i>You're already dead. Everybody!</i>

00:24:04.193 --> 00:24:06.685
<i>Him. You. You're dead already.</i>

00:24:06.779 --> 00:24:09.646
<i>This whole place,
everything you see is gone!</i>

00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:13.825
<i>You're the one living in the dream,
'cause I know it happens!</i>

00:24:13.911 --> 00:24:15.868
<i>It happens!</i>

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:29.832
I feel much better now.

00:24:29.927 --> 00:24:31.793
Clearer.

00:24:31.887 --> 00:24:34.675
Yes, your attitude has been...

00:24:34.765 --> 00:24:37.052
much improved lately.

00:24:46.402 --> 00:24:48.894
It's helped me to have a goal...

00:24:48.988 --> 00:24:52.151
something to look forward to.

00:24:52.241 --> 00:24:53.402
What is that?

00:24:53.492 --> 00:24:55.824
Well, you said...

00:24:55.911 --> 00:24:59.745
that if I showed improvement
after six months...

00:24:59.832 --> 00:25:02.494
you would transfer me
to the minimum security wing...

00:25:02.584 --> 00:25:05.326
and I could have visitors.

00:25:06.964 --> 00:25:11.003
Well, it's been six months and...

00:25:12.136 --> 00:25:14.423
I was looking forward
to seeing my son.

00:25:15.472 --> 00:25:16.928
I see.

00:25:20.185 --> 00:25:24.349
Let's go back to what you were saying
about those Terminator machines.

00:25:25.524 --> 00:25:28.892
Now you think they don't exist?

00:25:28.986 --> 00:25:33.105
They don't exist.
I know that now.

00:25:33.198 --> 00:25:36.361
But you've told me on many occasions
about how you crushed one...

00:25:36.452 --> 00:25:38.534
in a hydraulic press.

00:25:39.913 --> 00:25:43.031
If I had, there would have
been some evidence.

00:25:43.125 --> 00:25:45.537
They would have found something
at the factory.

00:25:45.627 --> 00:25:47.709
I see.

00:25:47.796 --> 00:25:51.209
<i>So you don't believe anymore
that the company covered it up?</i>

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:56.377
<i>No. Why would they?</i>

00:25:56.597 --> 00:25:59.715
Let's try a new position
right there.

00:26:09.651 --> 00:26:11.141
Mr. Dyson?

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:15.647
The materials team
is running another —

00:26:15.741 --> 00:26:17.402
- Mr. Dyson.
- Yes?

00:26:17.493 --> 00:26:20.451
The materials team is running
another series this afternoon.

00:26:20.537 --> 00:26:23.495
You have to sign for the — it.

00:26:23.582 --> 00:26:26.415
- You have to sign it out.
- Okay. I'll get it.

00:26:29.379 --> 00:26:32.417
I know I haven't been here long,
but I was wondering if you know —

00:26:32.508 --> 00:26:33.873
Know what?

00:26:33.967 --> 00:26:36.584
If you know where “it” came from.

00:26:36.678 --> 00:26:40.091
I asked them the same question once.
You know what they told me?

00:26:40.182 --> 00:26:42.139
Don't ask.

00:26:48.065 --> 00:26:51.103
- Good morning, Mr. Dyson.
- How's it going?

00:26:51.193 --> 00:26:54.106
Insert key. Left on three.

00:26:54.196 --> 00:26:56.528
Two, one, turn.

00:26:59.618 --> 00:27:02.861
- How are the wife and kids?
- Great. Thanks.

00:27:30.065 --> 00:27:33.103
So what do you think, Doctor?

00:27:33.986 --> 00:27:35.943
Haven't I shown improvement?

00:27:37.197 --> 00:27:39.985
Well, Sarah, here's the problem.

00:27:41.076 --> 00:27:43.488
I know how smart you are.

00:27:43.579 --> 00:27:45.616
You're just telling me
what I want to hear.

00:27:46.665 --> 00:27:49.703
I don't think you really believe
what you're telling me today.

00:27:49.793 --> 00:27:53.707
If I put you in minimum security,
you'll just try to escape again.

00:27:58.552 --> 00:28:00.839
You have to let me see my son.

00:28:02.097 --> 00:28:03.679
Please.

00:28:07.644 --> 00:28:10.853
He's in great danger.
He's naked without me.

00:28:12.274 --> 00:28:13.730
If I could make a phone call —

00:28:13.817 --> 00:28:16.275
I'm afraid not.
Not for a while.

00:28:18.488 --> 00:28:20.946
I don't see any choice but to
recommend to the review board...

00:28:21.033 --> 00:28:23.616
that you stay here
for another six months.

00:28:26.788 --> 00:28:30.076
I'll kill you,
you son of a bitch!

00:28:31.126 --> 00:28:33.788
You son of a bitch!

00:28:34.588 --> 00:28:38.422
Ten CCs of sodium amobarbital, stat!

00:28:38.508 --> 00:28:41.421
- You don't know what you're doing!
- Get some restraints in here now!

00:28:43.388 --> 00:28:46.972
You don't know what you're doing!

00:28:50.812 --> 00:28:53.099
<i>Model citizen.</i>

00:29:32.145 --> 00:29:34.853
You just missed him.
He was here 15 minutes ago.

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:38.103
- He was going to the galleria.
- Yeah.

00:29:38.193 --> 00:29:39.979
The galleria?

00:30:25.198 --> 00:30:28.407
I'm gonna get some quarters.
I'll be back, all right?

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:46.133
- Oh, no!
- Girls, do you know John Connor?

00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:52.632
Hey, do you know this guy?

00:30:52.726 --> 00:30:54.888
Nah, I don't know him.

00:31:00.233 --> 00:31:02.600
- John.
- Not now.

00:31:02.694 --> 00:31:05.937
There's this cop scoping for you.
Check it out.

00:31:08.492 --> 00:31:10.403
- He's right over there.
- Split, man.

00:31:10.494 --> 00:31:12.952
- Just go.
- Yeah.

00:31:17.667 --> 00:31:18.907
I saw that kid —

00:31:34.267 --> 00:31:36.178
You're not supposed to
be in here!

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:03.126
Get down.

00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:16.071
Mister, are you all right?

00:33:17.245 --> 00:33:18.406
You all right?

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:34.926
Come on!

00:34:14.803 --> 00:34:16.259
Goddamn!

00:38:55.375 --> 00:38:58.083
Okay, time-out.
Stop the bike.

00:38:58.169 --> 00:39:00.752
Time-out.
Come on, stop the bike.

00:39:13.852 --> 00:39:16.560
Holy shit.
Now, don't take this the wrong way.

00:39:16.646 --> 00:39:19.013
- You are a Terminator, right?
- Yes.

00:39:19.107 --> 00:39:21.940
Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.

00:39:33.538 --> 00:39:35.449
Holy shit.

00:39:36.958 --> 00:39:39.541
You're really real.

00:39:39.627 --> 00:39:41.584
I mean —

00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:47.048
You're like a machine underneath,
right?

00:39:47.135 --> 00:39:48.625
But alive outside?

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:50.631
I'm a cybernetic organism.

00:39:50.722 --> 00:39:53.430
Living tissue
over metal endoskeleton.

00:40:08.239 --> 00:40:10.401
This is intense.

00:40:10.491 --> 00:40:13.279
Get a grip, John. Okay.

00:40:15.872 --> 00:40:17.988
You're not here to kill me.

00:40:18.082 --> 00:40:22.041
I figured that part out for myself.
So what's the deal?

00:40:22.128 --> 00:40:27.544
- My mission is to protect you.
- Yeah? Who sent you?

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:30.876
You did.
Thirty-five years from now...

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:34.964
you reprogrammed me to be
your protector here in this time.

00:40:35.058 --> 00:40:37.800
Oh, this is deep.

00:41:00.249 --> 00:41:03.241
So this other guy,
he's a Terminator like you, right?

00:41:03.544 --> 00:41:07.037
Not like me.
A T-1000, advanced prototype.

00:41:08.675 --> 00:41:10.461
More advanced than you are?

00:41:10.551 --> 00:41:15.045
- Yes. A mimetic poly-alloy.
- What the hell does that mean?

00:41:15.139 --> 00:41:19.383
- Liquid metal.
- Where are we going?

00:41:19.477 --> 00:41:22.811
We have to get out of the city
immediately and avoid the authorities.

00:41:22.897 --> 00:41:25.605
I gotta stop by my house.
I wanna pick up some stuff.

00:41:25.692 --> 00:41:30.482
Negative. The T-1000 would definitely
try to reacquire you there.

00:41:30.571 --> 00:41:33.313
- You sure?
- I would.

00:41:43.918 --> 00:41:46.580
Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks...

00:41:48.881 --> 00:41:50.337
but I gotta warn 'em.

00:41:50.425 --> 00:41:52.792
Shit. You got a quarter?

00:42:01.561 --> 00:42:04.553
- Hello.
<i>- Janelle, it's me.</i>

00:42:04.647 --> 00:42:07.014
- John?
<i>- Is everything all right?</i>

00:42:07.108 --> 00:42:09.520
- Are you guys okay?
<i>- Sure, honey, everything's okay.</i>

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:12.693
- Are you all right?
<i>- Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:16.364
John, it's late.
I was beginning to worry about you.

00:42:16.451 --> 00:42:19.159
If you hurry home, we can sit down
and have dinner together.

00:42:19.245 --> 00:42:20.781
I'm making beef stew.

00:42:20.872 --> 00:42:23.785
Somethings wrong.
She's never this nice.

00:42:23.875 --> 00:42:25.661
Where are you?

00:42:25.752 --> 00:42:28.619
What the hell is
the goddamn dog barking at?

00:42:28.713 --> 00:42:31.956
Hey, shut up,
you worthless piece of shit!

00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:33.506
The dog's really barking.

00:42:33.593 --> 00:42:35.800
You were gonna tell the kid
to get rid of that mutt.

00:42:39.724 --> 00:42:42.466
John, it's late.
Please don't make me worry.

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:44.267
Could he already be there?

00:42:45.396 --> 00:42:46.682
Are you okay?

00:42:46.773 --> 00:42:50.767
- I'm fight here. I'm fine.
<i>- Are you sure you're all right?</i>

00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:54.194
- What's the dog's name?
- Max.

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:56.612
Hey, Janelle.
What's wrong with Wolfie?

00:42:56.699 --> 00:42:59.282
I can hear him barking.
Is he okay?

00:42:59.368 --> 00:43:03.236
Wolfie's fine, honey.
Wolfie's just fine.

00:43:03.331 --> 00:43:04.992
Where are you?

00:43:06.584 --> 00:43:07.665
Your foster parents are dead.

00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:47.531
I need a minute here.

00:43:47.625 --> 00:43:51.960
You're telling me that this thing
can imitate anything it touches?

00:43:52.046 --> 00:43:54.959
Anything it samples
by physical contact.

00:43:55.049 --> 00:43:56.460
Get real.

00:43:56.551 --> 00:44:00.294
It could disguise itself
as a pack of cigarettes?

00:44:00.388 --> 00:44:02.299
No, only an object
of equal size.

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:04.757
Why not just become a bomb
or something to get me?

00:44:05.101 --> 00:44:07.058
It can't form complex machines.

00:44:07.145 --> 00:44:09.182
Guns and explosives
have chemicals, moving parts.

00:44:09.272 --> 00:44:12.936
It doesn't work that way.
But it can form solid metal shapes.

00:44:13.025 --> 00:44:16.063
- Like what?
- Knives and stabbing weapons.

00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:49.058
These were taken by
a video surveillance camera...

00:44:49.145 --> 00:44:52.638
at the West Highland Police Station
in 1984.

00:44:54.025 --> 00:44:56.107
He killed 17 police officers
that night.

00:44:58.446 --> 00:45:00.483
Men with families...

00:45:02.074 --> 00:45:03.485
children.

00:45:05.119 --> 00:45:07.486
These were taken at a mall
in Reseda...

00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:09.787
today.

00:45:10.958 --> 00:45:14.167
Miss Connor, we know you know
who this guy is.

00:45:17.590 --> 00:45:21.333
I just sat here and told you
that your son is missing...

00:45:21.427 --> 00:45:24.260
that the foster parents
have been murdered.

00:45:24.347 --> 00:45:26.088
We know this guy's involved.

00:45:27.141 --> 00:45:30.475
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Don't you care?

00:45:35.358 --> 00:45:39.022
We're wasting our time.
Let's go.

00:45:39.111 --> 00:45:41.648
Sorry, guys.

00:45:41.739 --> 00:45:46.028
She's grown more disconnected
from reality as time goes on.

00:45:46.118 --> 00:45:48.325
I'm afraid she can't help us now.

00:45:48.412 --> 00:45:51.621
If she clears at all and can
give us anything, I'll call you.

00:45:51.707 --> 00:45:53.323
Sure.

00:45:53.417 --> 00:45:56.375
Douglas, take her back to her room.

00:45:56.462 --> 00:45:57.623
Yes, sir.

00:45:59.173 --> 00:46:01.289
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.

00:46:01.509 --> 00:46:03.420
You see...

00:46:03.511 --> 00:46:06.720
we spent a lot of time in Nicaragua
and places like that.

00:46:07.974 --> 00:46:12.309
For a while there, she was with
this crazy ex-Green Beret guy...

00:46:12.395 --> 00:46:13.760
running guns.

00:46:13.854 --> 00:46:16.767
Then there were some other guys.

00:46:16.857 --> 00:46:18.848
She'd shack up with anybody
she could learn from...

00:46:18.943 --> 00:46:22.186
so she could teach me how to be
this great military leader.

00:46:23.948 --> 00:46:25.939
Then she gets busted.

00:46:26.033 --> 00:46:29.651
It's like, “Sorry, kid, your mom's
a psycho. Didn't you know?”

00:46:31.872 --> 00:46:35.786
Like everything I've been brought up
to believe is all made-up bullshit.

00:46:35.876 --> 00:46:37.708
I hated her for that.

00:46:41.882 --> 00:46:44.419
But everything she said was true.

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:47.677
She knew...

00:46:49.849 --> 00:46:51.931
and nobody believed her...

00:46:53.686 --> 00:46:55.597
not even me.

00:46:57.565 --> 00:46:59.431
Listen. We gotta get her
out of there.

00:46:59.525 --> 00:47:02.893
Negative. The T-1000's highest
probability for success now...

00:47:02.987 --> 00:47:06.025
will be to copy Sarah Connor and wait
for you to make contact with her.

00:47:06.115 --> 00:47:08.197
Great. What happens to her?

00:47:08.284 --> 00:47:11.151
Typically, the subject being copied
is terminated.

00:47:11.245 --> 00:47:14.488
Shit! Why didn't you tell me?
We gotta go right now!

00:47:14.582 --> 00:47:16.664
Negative.
It's not a mission priority.

00:47:16.751 --> 00:47:18.913
Fuck you!
She's a priority to me!

00:47:20.755 --> 00:47:24.749
Goddamn it!
What's your problem? Help!

00:47:24.842 --> 00:47:26.628
This does not help our mission.

00:47:26.719 --> 00:47:29.177
Get this psycho off of me!
Help!

00:47:29.263 --> 00:47:32.301
I'm being kidnapped!
Get this psycho off of me!

00:47:32.391 --> 00:47:33.426
Let me go!

00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:39.766
Why did you do that?

00:47:39.857 --> 00:47:41.768
Because you told me to.

00:47:44.612 --> 00:47:46.023
What?

00:47:51.077 --> 00:47:53.034
You have to do what I say?

00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:55.327
That's one of my mission parameters.

00:47:56.624 --> 00:47:59.742
Prove it.
Stand on one foot.

00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:03.665
Yes!

00:48:05.883 --> 00:48:09.467
Cool. My own Terminator. Wow.

00:48:10.971 --> 00:48:12.211
You okay, kid?

00:48:12.306 --> 00:48:13.671
Take a hike, bozo.

00:48:13.766 --> 00:48:16.349
Let's get outta here, man.

00:48:16.435 --> 00:48:18.301
Fuck you, you little dipshit!

00:48:19.105 --> 00:48:20.516
Dipshit?

00:48:22.691 --> 00:48:24.807
Put your leg down.

00:48:24.902 --> 00:48:29.738
- Did you call <i>moi</i> a dipshit?
- Just trying to help this punk.

00:48:29.824 --> 00:48:32.156
Grab this guy.

00:48:33.327 --> 00:48:34.943
Get him off of me!

00:48:35.037 --> 00:48:37.119
Now who's the dipshit...

00:48:37.206 --> 00:48:38.992
you jock douche bag?

00:48:48.092 --> 00:48:50.550
Put the gun down now!

00:48:50.636 --> 00:48:53.845
- Get outta here!
- Come on. Let's split!

00:49:00.813 --> 00:49:02.724
You were gonna kill that guy!

00:49:02.815 --> 00:49:04.977
Of course. I'm a Terminator.

00:49:07.194 --> 00:49:09.811
Listen to me very carefully, okay?

00:49:09.905 --> 00:49:13.239
You're not a Terminator anymore,
all right?

00:49:13.325 --> 00:49:15.737
You got that?

00:49:15.828 --> 00:49:18.069
You just can't go around
killing people.

00:49:18.164 --> 00:49:19.199
Why?

00:49:20.207 --> 00:49:22.323
What do you mean, why?
'Cause you can't.

00:49:23.419 --> 00:49:26.207
Because you just can't.
Trust me on this.

00:49:32.261 --> 00:49:35.720
Look. I'm gonna go get my mom.

00:49:35.806 --> 00:49:38.639
I order you to help me.

00:52:06.206 --> 00:52:08.618
You have a Sarah Connor here?

00:52:08.709 --> 00:52:10.370
You're runnin' kind of late.

00:52:10.461 --> 00:52:12.828
They've been in there for an hour.

00:52:12.921 --> 00:52:15.333
Hold on a second.
I'll buzz you in.

00:52:17.176 --> 00:52:21.044
Oh, here come your friends now.

00:53:22.783 --> 00:53:26.196
- Gwen, you want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

00:53:26.286 --> 00:53:29.324
- How 'bout a beer?
- Yeah, right.

00:53:53.147 --> 00:53:56.435
- Hey, I got a full house.
- That's good, Louis.

00:53:56.525 --> 00:53:58.766
Must be my lucky day.

00:56:21.628 --> 00:56:24.086
You're right about number 24.

00:56:24.172 --> 00:56:27.164
Increase the medication
to 250 milligrams.

00:56:27.259 --> 00:56:30.126
- Same kind?
- Mm-hmm.

00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:47.272
You!

00:56:49.781 --> 00:56:51.692
You broke my arm.

00:56:51.783 --> 00:56:54.571
There are 215 bones
in the human body.

00:56:54.661 --> 00:56:57.244
That's one. Now, don't move.

00:57:03.211 --> 00:57:04.918
What are you going to do?

00:57:08.425 --> 00:57:10.507
Why do we stop now?

00:57:11.803 --> 00:57:15.592
You gotta promise me
you're not gonna kill anyone, right?

00:57:15.682 --> 00:57:18.265
- Right.
- Swear?

00:57:18.352 --> 00:57:19.842
What?

00:57:19.937 --> 00:57:23.020
Just put up your hand and say,
“I swear I won't kill anyone.”

00:57:24.149 --> 00:57:26.937
I swear I will not kill anyone.

00:57:27.027 --> 00:57:28.188
All right. Let's go.

00:57:35.202 --> 00:57:37.193
Visiting hours is 10:00 to 4:00...

00:57:37.287 --> 00:57:39.528
Monday through Friday.

00:57:43.251 --> 00:57:44.457
What are you doing?

00:57:44.544 --> 00:57:47.161
You son of a bitch!
You shot me!

00:57:48.966 --> 00:57:50.252
Crazy bastard!

00:57:54.554 --> 00:57:56.841
Don't shoot me again.
Don't kill me.

00:58:00.394 --> 00:58:02.351
He'll live.

00:58:16.827 --> 00:58:18.943
Son of a bitch!

00:58:20.455 --> 00:58:21.741
Let's try to remain calm.

00:58:21.832 --> 00:58:23.743
Open it, or he'll be dead
before he hits the floor.

00:58:23.834 --> 00:58:25.871
There's no way, Connor.
Let him go.

00:58:25.961 --> 00:58:28.498
- Open the door.
- It ain't gonna happen.

00:58:28.588 --> 00:58:30.420
Take it easy, Sarah.

00:58:30.507 --> 00:58:33.625
It won't work. You're no killer.
I don't believe you can do it.

00:58:33.719 --> 00:58:36.677
You're already dead. Everybody dies.
You know I believe it.

00:58:36.763 --> 00:58:38.800
So don't fuck with me!

00:58:38.890 --> 00:58:40.597
Open the door!

00:58:47.441 --> 00:58:49.057
Back off!

00:58:49.151 --> 00:58:50.562
Get back!

00:58:50.652 --> 00:58:52.609
I'll pump him full of this shit.
I swear!

00:58:53.947 --> 00:58:55.984
Don't move!

00:58:57.159 --> 00:58:58.320
Drop the shit!

00:58:58.410 --> 00:59:00.276
Do it!

00:59:00.370 --> 00:59:02.281
Get in the office.

00:59:02.372 --> 00:59:04.409
On the floor, face down.
Not you!

00:59:04.499 --> 00:59:06.160
Open the door.

00:59:09.046 --> 00:59:12.459
On the floor. Hold it open.
Face the wall!

00:59:28.482 --> 00:59:30.314
Get her!

00:59:58.011 --> 01:00:01.003
Hurry up! Open the door!
The door's locked!

01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:03.965
Let's go! Open it!

01:00:06.436 --> 01:00:08.393
- She broke it off.
- Open it!

01:00:13.819 --> 01:00:16.151
Let's go around! Come on!
Move it!

01:00:48.311 --> 01:00:49.392
Mom, wait!

01:00:56.236 --> 01:00:57.226
Come back here!

01:01:01.867 --> 01:01:03.483
- Help her!
- Wait here.

01:01:03.577 --> 01:01:06.160
- Hurry up!
- He'll kill us all!

01:01:07.455 --> 01:01:08.695
Hold her.

01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:11.411
He'll kill us all!

01:01:33.607 --> 01:01:35.939
Mom, are you okay? Mom!

01:01:40.405 --> 01:01:42.817
Come with me
if you want to live.

01:01:42.908 --> 01:01:45.445
It's okay, Mom.
He's here to help.

01:02:10.143 --> 01:02:11.178
Go.

01:02:43.551 --> 01:02:46.043
What the fuck is it?
What the fuck is going on?

01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:02.692
Get down.

01:03:38.648 --> 01:03:40.184
Out of the car!

01:03:41.568 --> 01:03:42.729
Right now!

01:04:07.218 --> 01:04:08.253
Go!

01:04:19.522 --> 01:04:20.728
I'm out.

01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:29.441
- Come on.
- Here.

01:04:31.951 --> 01:04:34.067
Reload.

01:04:43.004 --> 01:04:44.961
Last one!

01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:53.762
Hang on.

01:05:19.958 --> 01:05:21.494
Ready!

01:05:35.223 --> 01:05:37.134
Here, drive.

01:06:30.361 --> 01:06:32.568
He's not back there.
There's nobody behind us.

01:06:32.655 --> 01:06:34.737
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:06:37.076 --> 01:06:38.237
Can you see anything?

01:06:39.412 --> 01:06:40.743
I see everything.

01:06:43.625 --> 01:06:45.241
Cool.

01:06:48.838 --> 01:06:50.704
Come here.

01:06:56.513 --> 01:06:58.254
I said I was okay.

01:06:59.057 --> 01:07:02.220
John, it was stupid of you
to go there.

01:07:03.102 --> 01:07:05.434
You have to be smarter
than that.

01:07:05.522 --> 01:07:07.104
You were almost killed.

01:07:08.274 --> 01:07:10.106
What were you thinking?

01:07:10.944 --> 01:07:13.527
You cannot risk yourself,
even for me.

01:07:13.613 --> 01:07:16.822
Do you understand?
You're too important.

01:07:16.908 --> 01:07:19.570
Do you understand?

01:07:22.455 --> 01:07:23.570
But...

01:07:25.458 --> 01:07:28.951
I had to get you out of that place.
I'm sorry.

01:07:30.213 --> 01:07:32.580
I didn't need your help.
I can take care of myself.

01:07:39.806 --> 01:07:41.422
What's wrong with your eyes?

01:07:43.393 --> 01:07:44.804
Nothing.

01:07:54.737 --> 01:07:57.195
So, what's your story?

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:08.831
You okay?

01:08:08.918 --> 01:08:10.329
Fine.

01:08:12.171 --> 01:08:15.505
Say, that's a nice bike.

01:08:37.989 --> 01:08:39.696
Watch it, lug nuts.

01:08:47.206 --> 01:08:50.619
Listen, do you know
what you're doing?

01:08:50.710 --> 01:08:53.498
I have detailed files
on human anatomy.

01:08:54.422 --> 01:08:56.379
I bet.

01:08:56.466 --> 01:08:59.458
Makes you a more efficient killer,
right?

01:08:59.552 --> 01:09:00.667
Correct.

01:09:06.726 --> 01:09:08.717
Does it hurt
when you get shot?

01:09:09.771 --> 01:09:13.230
I sense injuries.
The data could be called “pain.”

01:09:15.568 --> 01:09:17.479
John, help me with the light.

01:09:17.570 --> 01:09:19.857
- Will these heal up?
- Yes.

01:09:19.947 --> 01:09:24.157
Good. If you can't pass for human,
you're not much good to us.

01:09:24.243 --> 01:09:26.951
How long do you live?
I mean, last. Whatever.

01:09:27.038 --> 01:09:30.326
A hundred and twenty years
with my existing power cell.

01:09:30.416 --> 01:09:33.329
Can you learn stuff that you
haven't been programmed with...

01:09:33.419 --> 01:09:34.830
so you can be...

01:09:36.089 --> 01:09:38.797
you know, more human...

01:09:38.883 --> 01:09:41.591
and not such a dork
all the time?

01:09:44.764 --> 01:09:48.302
My CPU is a neural net processor,
a learning computer.

01:09:48.393 --> 01:09:52.728
But Skynet presets the switch
to read-only when we're sent out alone.

01:09:54.107 --> 01:09:56.519
Doesn't want you to do
too much thinking, huh?

01:09:56.609 --> 01:09:57.940
No.

01:09:59.487 --> 01:10:01.774
Can we reset the switch?

01:10:19.799 --> 01:10:24.259
Rotate the two locking cylinders
counterclockwise.

01:10:30.143 --> 01:10:31.633
Do it.

01:10:39.944 --> 01:10:42.276
Now open the port cover.

01:10:44.824 --> 01:10:47.361
Pull to break the seal.

01:10:50.496 --> 01:10:54.490
Good, now remove
the shock-damping assembly.

01:10:58.045 --> 01:11:01.208
You can now access the CPU.

01:11:01.299 --> 01:11:03.666
- Do you see it?
- Yes.

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:07.674
Hold the CPU by its base tab.

01:11:07.764 --> 01:11:09.175
Pull.

01:11:46.552 --> 01:11:48.259
Do you see the pin switch?

01:11:48.346 --> 01:11:50.212
No! No!

01:11:51.224 --> 01:11:53.841
- Out of my way, John.
- Don't kill him.

01:11:53.935 --> 01:11:57.223
It, John, not him.
It.

01:11:57.313 --> 01:12:00.772
Okay, it.
But we need it.

01:12:00.858 --> 01:12:03.475
Listen to me.
You listen.

01:12:03.569 --> 01:12:05.685
We're better off on our own.

01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:07.566
But he's the only proof we have...

01:12:07.657 --> 01:12:10.149
of the future and the war
and all that.

01:12:10.243 --> 01:12:11.608
Maybe.

01:12:14.247 --> 01:12:16.284
I don't trust it.

01:12:16.374 --> 01:12:18.081
But he's my friend, all right?

01:12:18.918 --> 01:12:21.660
You don't know what it's like
to try to kill one of these things...

01:12:21.754 --> 01:12:25.338
and if something goes wrong
this could be our last chance, so move!

01:12:25.424 --> 01:12:27.506
If I'm ever supposed to be
this great military leader...

01:12:27.593 --> 01:12:31.427
maybe you should start listening
to my leadership ideas once in a while.

01:12:34.433 --> 01:12:39.052
Because if my own mother won't,
how do you expect anyone else to?

01:12:53.286 --> 01:12:56.324
All right, play it your way.

01:13:03.796 --> 01:13:05.833
Was there a problem?

01:13:05.923 --> 01:13:07.413
No problem.

01:13:09.135 --> 01:13:10.341
None whatsoever.

01:13:44.003 --> 01:13:45.914
Are we learning yet?

01:13:58.351 --> 01:14:01.309
We have to get as far away
from the city as possible.

01:14:05.024 --> 01:14:06.640
Just head south.

01:14:15.409 --> 01:14:16.991
Keep it under 65.

01:14:17.078 --> 01:14:20.070
- We don't want to be pulled over.
- Affirmative.

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:25.784
You gotta listen to the way
people talk.

01:14:25.878 --> 01:14:29.371
You don't say “affirmative”
or some shit like that.

01:14:29.465 --> 01:14:31.797
You say, <i>“No problemo.”</i>

01:14:31.884 --> 01:14:35.798
If someone comes off to you
with an attitude, you say, “Eat me.”

01:14:35.888 --> 01:14:40.177
And if you want to shine them on,
it's “<i>Hasta la vista,</i> baby.”

01:14:43.396 --> 01:14:45.512
Yeah, or “Later, dick-wad.”

01:14:45.606 --> 01:14:48.644
If someone gets upset,
you say, “Chill out.”

01:14:48.734 --> 01:14:50.099
Or you can do combinations.

01:14:50.903 --> 01:14:53.190
Chill out, dick-wad.

01:14:54.031 --> 01:14:56.022
That's great.
See? You're getting it.

01:15:08.254 --> 01:15:10.120
You got any cash?

01:15:10.214 --> 01:15:13.752
I got a couple hundred bucks.
I'll give you half.

01:15:13.843 --> 01:15:15.504
Mom!

01:15:16.679 --> 01:15:18.670
Get some food.

01:15:20.683 --> 01:15:23.095
No sense of humor.

01:15:28.524 --> 01:15:32.108
That's another thing.
You can lighten up a bit yourself.

01:15:33.029 --> 01:15:35.191
This severe routine
is getting old, okay.

01:15:35.281 --> 01:15:37.113
I mean, you're acting
like such a geek.

01:15:37.199 --> 01:15:39.190
Smile once in a while.

01:15:39.285 --> 01:15:40.616
Smile?

01:15:40.703 --> 01:15:44.617
Yeah, you know, smile.
Watch.

01:15:45.624 --> 01:15:49.333
Hi. Nice place you got here.
How's business?

01:15:50.296 --> 01:15:52.128
Give me a break.

01:15:53.049 --> 01:15:55.040
Okay, bad example.

01:15:56.177 --> 01:15:57.838
See that guy over there?

01:15:57.928 --> 01:15:59.794
That's a smile.

01:16:19.158 --> 01:16:20.614
That's good.

01:16:20.701 --> 01:16:23.659
Maybe you could practice
in front of a mirror or something.

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:32.831
Want some of my fries?

01:16:42.848 --> 01:16:45.306
- Need any help?
- No.

01:16:46.727 --> 01:16:48.468
- I got you!
- No, you didn't!

01:16:56.821 --> 01:16:59.813
We're not gonna make it, are we?

01:17:01.867 --> 01:17:03.073
People, I mean.

01:17:06.247 --> 01:17:08.079
It's in your nature
to destroy yourselves.

01:17:09.166 --> 01:17:12.079
Yeah. Major drag, huh?

01:17:12.169 --> 01:17:15.412
Break it up before I wring
both of your necks.

01:17:17.216 --> 01:17:20.299
I need to know
how Skynet gets built.

01:17:20.386 --> 01:17:21.626
Who's responsible?

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:25.258
The man most directly responsible
is Miles Bennett Dyson.

01:17:25.349 --> 01:17:27.056
Who is that?

01:17:27.143 --> 01:17:31.057
He's the director of special projects
at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.

01:17:33.858 --> 01:17:35.599
Why him?

01:17:35.693 --> 01:17:39.061
In a few months, he creates
a revolutionary type of microprocessor.

01:17:40.114 --> 01:17:41.445
Go on. Then what?

01:17:42.575 --> 01:17:45.488
In three years Cyberdyne will become
the largest supplier...

01:17:45.578 --> 01:17:46.943
of military computer systems.

01:17:48.038 --> 01:17:50.951
All Stealth bombers are upgraded
with Cyberdyne computers...

01:17:51.041 --> 01:17:52.497
becoming fully unmanned.

01:17:52.585 --> 01:17:55.623
Afterwards they fly with
a perfect operational record.

01:17:55.713 --> 01:17:58.330
The Skynet funding bill is passed.

01:17:58.424 --> 01:18:01.712
The system goes on-line
on August 4, 1997.

01:18:01.802 --> 01:18:04.965
Human decisions are removed
from strategic defense.

01:18:05.055 --> 01:18:07.763
Skynet begins to learn
at a geometric rate.

01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:12.139
It becomes self-aware
at 2:14 a.m. Eastern time, August 29.

01:18:13.230 --> 01:18:15.813
In a panic,
they try to pull the plug.

01:18:16.942 --> 01:18:19.183
- Skynet fights back.
- Yes.

01:18:19.278 --> 01:18:22.020
It launches its missiles
against the targets in Russia.

01:18:22.114 --> 01:18:25.152
Why attack Russia?
Aren't they our friends now?

01:18:25.242 --> 01:18:29.611
Skynet knows the Russian counterattack
will eliminate its enemies over here.

01:18:29.705 --> 01:18:31.787
Jesus.

01:18:33.959 --> 01:18:35.791
How much do you know
about Dyson?

01:18:38.047 --> 01:18:39.958
I have detailed files.

01:18:41.175 --> 01:18:43.132
I want to know everything.

01:18:44.345 --> 01:18:48.430
What he looks like,
where he lives, everything.

01:19:00.069 --> 01:19:01.480
Miles.

01:19:03.906 --> 01:19:05.863
<i>Miles.</i>

01:19:23.759 --> 01:19:25.500
Are you going to work all day?

01:19:25.594 --> 01:19:29.462
I'm sorry, baby.
But this thing is just kicking my ass.

01:19:29.556 --> 01:19:30.842
Miles, it's Sunday.

01:19:30.933 --> 01:19:33.675
You promised to take the kids
to Raging Waters today.

01:19:35.271 --> 01:19:36.761
I can't...

01:19:37.439 --> 01:19:39.146
I'm on a roll.

01:19:51.996 --> 01:19:54.203
Baby, this is going
to blow them all away.

01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:57.373
- It's a neural net processor.
- I know. You told me.

01:19:57.459 --> 01:20:00.622
It's a neural net processor.
It thinks and learns like we do.

01:20:00.713 --> 01:20:03.375
It's superconducting
at room temperature.

01:20:03.465 --> 01:20:07.709
Other computers are just
pocket calculators by comparison.

01:20:09.638 --> 01:20:11.879
But why is that
so goddamn important, Miles?

01:20:11.974 --> 01:20:13.305
I really need to know...

01:20:13.392 --> 01:20:16.475
because sometimes I feel
like I'm going crazy here.

01:20:18.147 --> 01:20:20.138
Baby, I am this close.

01:20:21.233 --> 01:20:22.268
Come here.

01:20:24.903 --> 01:20:27.395
Imagine a jet airliner...

01:20:27.489 --> 01:20:30.151
with a pilot that never gets tired,
never makes mistakes...

01:20:30.242 --> 01:20:32.108
never shows up to work
with a hangover.

01:20:34.496 --> 01:20:36.908
Meet the pilot.

01:20:36.999 --> 01:20:40.082
Why did we get married, Miles?
Why did we have these children?

01:20:40.169 --> 01:20:41.204
You don't need us.

01:20:41.295 --> 01:20:44.708
Your heart and your mind
are in here.

01:20:44.798 --> 01:20:47.665
But it doesn't love you
like we do.

01:20:55.851 --> 01:20:58.468
I'm sorry. Really.

01:20:58.562 --> 01:21:02.806
How about spending some time
with your other babies?

01:21:05.486 --> 01:21:07.318
<i>Raging Waters!</i>

01:21:36.975 --> 01:21:38.932
Wait in the car.

01:22:17.141 --> 01:22:18.973
You're pretty jumpy, Connor.

01:22:39.746 --> 01:22:41.487
Hey, big John.

01:22:42.124 --> 01:22:43.239
What's up?

01:22:44.585 --> 01:22:46.826
He's cool, Enrique.
He's with me.

01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:50.083
He's... Uncle Bob.

01:22:50.174 --> 01:22:52.381
Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.

01:22:52.468 --> 01:22:54.209
Uncle Bob, huh?

01:22:55.304 --> 01:22:56.544
Okay.

01:23:03.562 --> 01:23:04.597
Drink?

01:23:09.943 --> 01:23:11.354
“Uncle Bob”?

01:23:13.363 --> 01:23:16.151
You're pretty famous,
all over the goddamn TV.

01:23:16.241 --> 01:23:18.903
Pictures of you, John,
your big friend here.

01:23:18.994 --> 01:23:20.951
Cops are going nuts
looking for you.

01:23:24.875 --> 01:23:28.834
I just came for my stuff.
I need clothes, food and a truck.

01:23:28.921 --> 01:23:30.958
How about the fillings in my teeth?

01:23:31.048 --> 01:23:33.210
Now, Enrique.

01:23:34.551 --> 01:23:36.758
You two,
you're on weapons detail.

01:23:36.845 --> 01:23:38.506
Let's go.

01:23:59.117 --> 01:24:01.028
One thing about my mom —

01:24:03.330 --> 01:24:05.287
she always plans ahead.

01:24:15.968 --> 01:24:17.174
Excellent.

01:24:27.813 --> 01:24:31.477
This is my best truck,
but the starter motor's gone.

01:24:31.567 --> 01:24:33.478
You got time to change it out?

01:24:33.569 --> 01:24:36.903
Yeah. I'm gonna wait till dark
to cross the border.

01:24:36.989 --> 01:24:38.479
Enrique.

01:24:38.574 --> 01:24:42.192
It's dangerous for you here.
You get out tonight too, okay?

01:24:42.286 --> 01:24:44.744
Sure.

01:24:44.830 --> 01:24:48.619
Just drop by anytime
and totally fuck up my life, all right?

01:24:53.046 --> 01:24:56.505
See, I grew up in places like this...

01:24:56.592 --> 01:24:59.004
so I just thought
that's how people lived —

01:25:00.345 --> 01:25:03.053
riding around in helicopters...

01:25:04.141 --> 01:25:06.348
learning how to blow shit up.

01:25:07.853 --> 01:25:10.515
But then when my mom got busted...

01:25:10.606 --> 01:25:12.973
I got put into a regular school.

01:25:13.650 --> 01:25:16.392
All the other kids
were into Nintendo.

01:25:30.667 --> 01:25:32.783
Are you ever afraid?

01:25:32.878 --> 01:25:34.164
No.

01:25:38.050 --> 01:25:39.836
Not even of dying?

01:25:40.385 --> 01:25:42.342
No.

01:25:46.683 --> 01:25:50.927
You don't feel any emotion about it,
one way or another?

01:25:51.021 --> 01:25:54.980
No. I have to stay functional
until my mission is complete.

01:25:59.988 --> 01:26:03.106
Then it doesn't matter.

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:06.909
I have to stay functional too.
“I'm too important.”

01:26:23.178 --> 01:26:25.044
That's definitely you.

01:26:35.607 --> 01:26:39.066
Most of the guys my mom
hung around with were geeks...

01:26:39.444 --> 01:26:42.937
but there was this one guy,
he was kinda cool.

01:26:43.031 --> 01:26:44.942
He taught me engines.

01:26:45.033 --> 01:26:47.195
Hold here.

01:26:47.285 --> 01:26:49.697
Mom screwed it up, of course.

01:26:49.788 --> 01:26:52.200
She'd always tell 'em
about Judgment Day...

01:26:52.290 --> 01:26:55.078
and me being this world leader.

01:26:55.168 --> 01:26:57.125
That'd be all she wrote.

01:26:58.463 --> 01:26:59.578
Torque wrench, please.

01:27:03.135 --> 01:27:06.344
I wish I could've met
my real dad.

01:27:06.430 --> 01:27:08.171
You will.

01:27:08.265 --> 01:27:10.427
Yeah, I guess.

01:27:10.517 --> 01:27:14.351
When I'm, like, 45, I think.

01:27:14.438 --> 01:27:18.147
They sent him back through time
to 1984.

01:27:18.233 --> 01:27:19.644
Man.

01:27:21.194 --> 01:27:23.652
He hasn't even been born yet.

01:27:25.449 --> 01:27:27.360
It messes with your head.

01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:33.033
- The other bolt.
- Oh. Here.

01:27:39.379 --> 01:27:42.917
Mom and him were only together
for one night.

01:27:43.008 --> 01:27:45.466
She still loves him, I guess.

01:27:45.552 --> 01:27:48.419
I see her crying sometimes.

01:27:48.513 --> 01:27:52.507
She denies it totally, of course,
like she got something stuck in her eye.

01:27:57.481 --> 01:27:59.017
Why do you cry?

01:28:00.108 --> 01:28:01.598
- You mean people?
- Yeah.

01:28:01.693 --> 01:28:03.058
I don't know.

01:28:03.153 --> 01:28:05.235
We just cry...

01:28:05.322 --> 01:28:07.859
you know, when it hurts.

01:28:13.955 --> 01:28:15.696
Pain causes it?

01:28:16.792 --> 01:28:18.908
No. It's different.

01:28:19.002 --> 01:28:22.290
It's when there's nothing wrong
with you, but you hurt anyway.

01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:23.962
- You get it?
- No.

01:28:25.217 --> 01:28:26.924
All right, my man!

01:28:28.762 --> 01:28:30.378
Give me five.

01:28:32.432 --> 01:28:34.548
Just put out your hand
like this.

01:28:35.894 --> 01:28:40.229
All right! Now hit me.
Give me five. Do the same thing.

01:28:44.945 --> 01:28:47.403
Okay, that's good.
Up high.

01:28:48.406 --> 01:28:49.646
Five low.

01:28:49.741 --> 01:28:51.402
Too slow.

01:28:54.412 --> 01:28:56.653
I'm just kidding.
One more time.

01:28:56.748 --> 01:28:58.955
Good. Now try it.

01:28:59.042 --> 01:29:00.999
Now do me.
Give me five.

01:29:02.462 --> 01:29:07.002
<i>Watching John with the machine,
it was suddenly so clear.</i>

01:29:07.092 --> 01:29:10.005
<i>The Terminator would never stop.</i>

01:29:10.095 --> 01:29:14.054
<i>It would never leave him,
never hurt him...</i>

01:29:14.140 --> 01:29:17.553
<i>never shout at him
or get drunk and hit him...</i>

01:29:17.644 --> 01:29:20.227
<i>or be too busy
to spend time with him.</i>

01:29:21.106 --> 01:29:23.188
<i>It would always be there...</i>

01:29:23.275 --> 01:29:25.937
<i>and it would die
to protect him.</i>

01:29:27.362 --> 01:29:30.696
<i>Of all the would-be fathers
who came and went over the years...</i>

01:29:30.782 --> 01:29:32.819
<i>this thing, this machine...</i>

01:29:32.909 --> 01:29:35.276
<i>was the only one
who measured up.</i>

01:29:36.037 --> 01:29:37.869
<i>In an insane world...</i>

01:29:37.956 --> 01:29:39.913
<i>it was the sanest choice.</i>

01:31:17.681 --> 01:31:19.638
Hey, let's try this one.

01:31:25.271 --> 01:31:27.433
There we go.

01:33:13.546 --> 01:33:16.038
She said go south with him
like you planned.

01:33:16.132 --> 01:33:18.339
- She'll meet you tomorrow.
- Mom!

01:33:20.136 --> 01:33:21.297
Mom, wait!

01:33:36.569 --> 01:33:38.025
“No fate.”

01:33:39.239 --> 01:33:41.697
No fate but what we make.

01:33:43.827 --> 01:33:45.818
My father told her this.

01:33:48.373 --> 01:33:52.662
I made him memorize it in the future
as a message to her.

01:33:54.337 --> 01:33:56.248
Never mind.

01:33:56.339 --> 01:33:59.673
Okay, the whole thing goes —

01:33:59.759 --> 01:34:02.467
The future's not set.

01:34:02.554 --> 01:34:06.047
There's no fate but what
we make for ourselves.

01:34:06.141 --> 01:34:09.133
She intends to change the future.

01:34:09.227 --> 01:34:10.683
Yeah, I guess.

01:34:12.230 --> 01:34:14.062
Oh, shit!

01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:16.060
- Dyson.
- Yeah.

01:34:16.151 --> 01:34:19.644
Gotta be. Miles Dyson.

01:34:19.737 --> 01:34:21.728
She's gonna blow him away.

01:34:21.823 --> 01:34:23.905
Come on! Let's go!

01:34:36.296 --> 01:34:38.333
This is tactically dangerous.

01:34:38.423 --> 01:34:39.538
Drive faster.

01:34:39.632 --> 01:34:42.124
The T-1000 has the same files
that I do.

01:34:42.218 --> 01:34:45.631
It knows what I know.
It might anticipate this move.

01:34:45.722 --> 01:34:48.214
I don't care.
We gotta stop her.

01:34:48.308 --> 01:34:50.219
Killing Dyson
might prevent the war.

01:34:50.310 --> 01:34:53.803
I don't care!
Haven't you learned anything yet?

01:34:53.897 --> 01:34:56.980
Haven't you figured out
why you can't kill people?

01:34:59.861 --> 01:35:02.353
Look, maybe you don't care
if you live or die...

01:35:02.447 --> 01:35:04.609
but everybody's not like that.

01:35:04.699 --> 01:35:08.283
We have feelings.
We hurt. We're afraid.

01:35:10.788 --> 01:35:14.452
You got to learn this stuff.
I'm not kidding. It's important.

01:35:52.121 --> 01:35:54.738
Danny, I told you to go to bed,
like your sister.

01:35:54.832 --> 01:35:58.200
Just a couple of minutes, Mom!

01:36:14.352 --> 01:36:16.684
Danny, your time is up!

01:36:16.771 --> 01:36:19.684
Come brush your teeth
and get to bed.

01:37:01.482 --> 01:37:02.813
Daddy!

01:37:02.900 --> 01:37:05.392
Danny, go! Go!

01:37:13.369 --> 01:37:15.781
- Tarissa, run!
- Oh, my God!

01:37:22.879 --> 01:37:24.916
Just take Danny and run!

01:37:25.006 --> 01:37:26.246
Run!

01:37:26.341 --> 01:37:28.082
Oh, Jesus! Miles!

01:37:46.986 --> 01:37:47.976
Daddy!

01:37:49.697 --> 01:37:51.153
Nobody fucking move!

01:37:51.991 --> 01:37:53.231
Don't hurt my daddy!

01:37:53.326 --> 01:37:54.862
On the floor, bitch.

01:37:54.952 --> 01:37:57.114
Get down now!

01:37:57.997 --> 01:37:59.078
Get out of the way!

01:37:59.165 --> 01:38:00.621
Don't hurt him!

01:38:02.126 --> 01:38:04.117
Get on the floor now!

01:38:07.173 --> 01:38:08.880
Just let the boy go.

01:38:08.966 --> 01:38:10.548
Shut up. Shut up.

01:38:10.635 --> 01:38:11.921
Shut up!

01:38:12.011 --> 01:38:14.594
It's all your fault, motherfucker.

01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:16.921
- It's all your fault!
- What?

01:38:17.016 --> 01:38:19.132
I'm not gonna let you do it.

01:39:11.154 --> 01:39:13.236
Shit! We're too late!

01:39:17.743 --> 01:39:18.858
Check them.

01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:24.531
Look at me, Mom.

01:39:24.625 --> 01:39:26.832
Are you hurt?

01:39:30.465 --> 01:39:32.547
I almost —

01:39:44.187 --> 01:39:46.519
It'll be okay.

01:39:46.606 --> 01:39:48.563
We'll figure something out.
Okay?

01:39:50.151 --> 01:39:51.767
I promise.

01:39:55.072 --> 01:39:58.030
You came here to stop me.

01:39:58.910 --> 01:40:00.867
Yeah, I did.

01:40:03.748 --> 01:40:05.739
I love you, John.

01:40:07.418 --> 01:40:09.000
I always have.

01:40:10.922 --> 01:40:12.333
I know.

01:40:19.347 --> 01:40:21.554
Deep penetration.

01:40:23.142 --> 01:40:25.053
No shattered bone.

01:40:25.144 --> 01:40:28.102
Hold here.
The pressure should stop the bleeding.

01:40:38.866 --> 01:40:40.277
Who are you people?

01:40:41.244 --> 01:40:42.655
Show him.

01:40:45.331 --> 01:40:49.495
Danny, I want you to come with me
right now. Show me your room.

01:41:30.001 --> 01:41:31.207
Oh, my God.

01:41:31.294 --> 01:41:33.956
Now listen to me
very carefully.

01:41:39.844 --> 01:41:43.963
<i>Dyson listened while the Terminator
laid it all down.</i>

01:41:44.056 --> 01:41:47.924
<i>Skynet. Judgment Day.</i>

01:41:48.019 --> 01:41:50.306
<i>The history of things to come.</i>

01:41:51.731 --> 01:41:54.473
<i>It's not every day that
you find out you're responsible...</i>

01:41:54.567 --> 01:41:57.400
<i>for three billion deaths.</i>

01:41:57.486 --> 01:41:59.397
<i>He took it pretty well.</i>

01:42:01.407 --> 01:42:03.865
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

01:42:09.874 --> 01:42:11.990
You're judging me...

01:42:12.084 --> 01:42:14.542
on things I haven't even done yet.

01:42:18.758 --> 01:42:20.874
How were we supposed to know?

01:42:23.346 --> 01:42:25.303
Yeah.

01:42:25.389 --> 01:42:27.756
Right.

01:42:27.850 --> 01:42:29.966
How were you supposed to know?

01:42:31.020 --> 01:42:34.729
Fucking men like you
built the hydrogen bomb.

01:42:34.815 --> 01:42:37.398
Men like you...

01:42:37.485 --> 01:42:38.896
thought it up.

01:42:42.782 --> 01:42:44.739
You think you're so creative.

01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:49.243
You don't know what it's like
to really create something...

01:42:49.330 --> 01:42:51.446
to create a life...

01:42:51.540 --> 01:42:53.076
to feel it growing inside you.

01:42:53.167 --> 01:42:56.080
All you know how to create
is death and destruction.

01:42:56.170 --> 01:42:57.831
Mom!

01:42:57.922 --> 01:43:01.665
We need to be a little more
constructive here. Okay?

01:43:01.759 --> 01:43:03.841
We still have to stop this
from happening, don't we?

01:43:03.928 --> 01:43:06.761
But I thought —

01:43:06.847 --> 01:43:10.841
Aren't we changing things right now,
changing the way it goes?

01:43:10.935 --> 01:43:15.725
That's right. There's no way I'm going
to finish the new processor. Not now.

01:43:15.815 --> 01:43:19.274
Forget it. I'm out of it.
I'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.

01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:21.226
That's not good enough.

01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:23.231
No one must follow your work.

01:43:23.322 --> 01:43:25.188
Right.

01:43:25.282 --> 01:43:29.617
All right, then we have to destroy
all the stuff at the lab —

01:43:29.704 --> 01:43:31.286
the files, the disk drives...

01:43:31.372 --> 01:43:33.989
everything here.

01:43:34.083 --> 01:43:36.165
Everything.

01:43:36.252 --> 01:43:38.163
I don't care.

01:43:39.463 --> 01:43:40.453
The chip.

01:43:40.548 --> 01:43:42.630
- Do you know about the chip?
- What chip?

01:43:42.717 --> 01:43:45.129
It's at Cyberdyne.
It's from the other one like you.

01:43:45.219 --> 01:43:47.927
The CPU from the first Terminator.

01:43:48.013 --> 01:43:50.380
Son of a bitch!
I knew it!

01:43:50.474 --> 01:43:53.182
They told us not to ask
where they got it.

01:43:53.269 --> 01:43:55.601
Those lying motherfuckers.

01:43:55.688 --> 01:43:57.474
It's scary stuff.
Radically advanced.

01:43:57.565 --> 01:43:58.680
It was smashed.

01:43:58.774 --> 01:44:02.392
It didn't work, but it gave us ideas,
took us in new directions.

01:44:02.486 --> 01:44:04.477
Things we would've never —

01:44:06.657 --> 01:44:08.739
All my work was based on it.

01:44:08.826 --> 01:44:10.658
It must be destroyed.

01:44:12.913 --> 01:44:15.905
Can you get us in?
Past security?

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.082
I think so, yeah. When?

01:44:23.007 --> 01:44:23.997
Now?

01:44:27.928 --> 01:44:30.966
<i>The future,
always so clear to me...</i>

01:44:31.056 --> 01:44:34.048
<i>had become like
a black highway at night.</i>

01:44:34.143 --> 01:44:36.851
<i>We were in
uncharted territory now...</i>

01:44:36.937 --> 01:44:39.850
<i>making up history
as we went along.</i>

01:45:18.187 --> 01:45:20.098
Carl, right?

01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:24.853
Friends from out of town.
I just thought I'd...

01:45:24.944 --> 01:45:26.935
take 'em upstairs
and show 'em around.

01:45:27.029 --> 01:45:30.317
Mr. Dyson, you know the rules
concerning visitors in the lab.

01:45:30.407 --> 01:45:32.569
I need written authorization —

01:45:33.619 --> 01:45:35.610
I insist.

01:45:35.704 --> 01:45:37.445
Don't even think about it.

01:45:48.425 --> 01:45:49.881
It's okay.

01:45:51.303 --> 01:45:54.421
It takes two keys, turned
simultaneously, to open the vault.

01:45:54.515 --> 01:45:57.428
The other one is in a locker
at the security station.

01:45:58.769 --> 01:46:00.225
Gibbons?

01:46:03.274 --> 01:46:05.106
Gibbons! Come on, man!

01:46:05.192 --> 01:46:08.275
You can't leave the desk
like that!

01:46:13.117 --> 01:46:14.607
Oh, shit.

01:46:32.177 --> 01:46:34.168
My card should access this.

01:46:38.851 --> 01:46:41.263
- What is it?
- Damn it.

01:46:41.353 --> 01:46:43.310
The silent alarm's been tripped.

01:46:49.486 --> 01:46:52.228
It's neutralized all the codes
in the entire building.

01:46:52.323 --> 01:46:54.234
Nothing will open anywhere now.

01:46:55.326 --> 01:46:57.158
We have to abort.

01:47:00.372 --> 01:47:03.785
We go all the way.
Okay?

01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:09.709
You guys get started on the lab.
I can open this.

01:47:09.798 --> 01:47:12.256
- I think it's that guy from the mall.
- It is.

01:47:12.343 --> 01:47:14.254
It's him and the woman.

01:47:15.846 --> 01:47:19.009
Just send everything
you got in the area right now.

01:47:21.226 --> 01:47:24.685
I have a personal entry code
for the lab. It may still work.

01:47:29.193 --> 01:47:30.228
It's no good.

01:47:30.319 --> 01:47:31.855
Let me try mine.

01:47:36.825 --> 01:47:38.907
John, fire in the hole!

01:47:50.965 --> 01:47:55.755
Wait! You can't go in there.
The fire set off the Halon system.

01:48:02.935 --> 01:48:05.393
You have to wait
until the gas clears.

01:48:07.898 --> 01:48:09.184
Put this on.

01:48:23.163 --> 01:48:25.655
All right, let's get to work.

01:48:46.854 --> 01:48:50.142
<i>All units in the vicinity
and all units able to respond...</i>

01:48:50.232 --> 01:48:55.022
<i>a 211 in progress, 2144 Kramer Street,
the Cyberdyne building.</i>

01:48:55.112 --> 01:48:56.773
<i>Suspect one is white female...</i>

01:48:56.864 --> 01:49:00.323
<i>identified as last name Connor,
first name Sarah.</i>

01:49:00.409 --> 01:49:03.322
<i>Escaped last night
from Pescadero State Hospital.</i>

01:49:03.412 --> 01:49:05.278
<i>Suspect two: White male...</i>

01:49:09.043 --> 01:49:11.159
All the disks in my office...

01:49:11.253 --> 01:49:13.369
all the disks
in that office over there...

01:49:13.464 --> 01:49:15.455
everything behind my desk...

01:49:15.549 --> 01:49:17.790
and all the processors
on my left.

01:49:17.885 --> 01:49:20.468
We'll blow those with the C4.

01:49:34.068 --> 01:49:36.105
Can I —

01:49:36.195 --> 01:49:37.981
Excuse me.

01:49:39.656 --> 01:49:42.273
Can I borrow that thing?

01:49:51.418 --> 01:49:53.705
I worked a lot of years on this thing.

01:49:57.883 --> 01:49:59.920
<i>One-Mary-23,
give me that location again.</i>

01:50:00.010 --> 01:50:01.751
<i>2111 Kramer.</i>

01:50:01.845 --> 01:50:04.963
<i>Suspects are armed and
considered extremely dangerous.</i>

01:50:57.234 --> 01:50:59.020
All right.

01:50:59.111 --> 01:51:00.897
7-2-5-6.

01:51:07.744 --> 01:51:09.075
Easy money.

01:51:18.172 --> 01:51:20.584
Oh, shit. Not good.

01:51:25.679 --> 01:51:27.295
How we doing?

01:51:27.389 --> 01:51:29.050
Primer cord is set.

01:51:29.141 --> 01:51:31.599
One more barrel,
two more minutes.

01:51:35.480 --> 01:51:38.393
- How do we set them off?
- Remote control.

01:51:38.483 --> 01:51:40.850
Piece of cake.

01:51:40.944 --> 01:51:42.480
- We got company.
- Police?

01:51:42.571 --> 01:51:45.905
- How many?
- All of 'em, I think.

01:51:45.991 --> 01:51:47.402
Go. I'll finish here.

01:51:49.369 --> 01:51:50.780
Come on.

01:51:51.872 --> 01:51:53.783
I'll take care of the police.

01:51:53.874 --> 01:51:55.160
Wait! You swore!

01:51:58.128 --> 01:51:59.584
Trust me.

01:52:12.851 --> 01:52:14.467
<i>You at the window!</i>

01:52:14.561 --> 01:52:18.020
<i>Drop your weapon and place
your hands on top of your head!</i>

01:52:19.358 --> 01:52:21.190
Holy shit!

01:52:21.276 --> 01:52:22.812
That's a mini-gun!

01:52:45.050 --> 01:52:47.382
- Come on!
- Oh, shit!

01:52:47.469 --> 01:52:49.005
Go! Go! Go!

01:53:36.601 --> 01:53:38.057
Fire!

01:53:55.412 --> 01:53:57.028
Same time, to the left.

01:53:57.122 --> 01:53:59.454
One, two, three, go.

01:54:11.595 --> 01:54:14.428
In order to get that out —

01:54:21.229 --> 01:54:23.971
We got Skynet by the balls now.

01:54:24.066 --> 01:54:25.773
Come on, let's book.

01:54:26.693 --> 01:54:28.604
Hold your fire!

01:54:53.804 --> 01:54:56.296
- Ready to rock?
- Ready.

01:54:59.059 --> 01:55:00.345
Time to go.

01:55:00.435 --> 01:55:01.891
Now.

01:55:01.978 --> 01:55:05.516
- Take this. They'll use gas.
- Come on.

01:55:05.607 --> 01:55:08.690
Get started on the door.
Miles, hand me the detonator.

01:55:32.968 --> 01:55:35.710
Mom! Mom!

01:56:20.098 --> 01:56:21.213
Shit!

01:56:22.642 --> 01:56:25.555
She's in the clean room.
There's no way outta there.

01:56:35.071 --> 01:56:36.061
Get down!

01:56:43.580 --> 01:56:44.991
Here.

01:57:10.524 --> 01:57:13.937
I don't know how much longer
I can hold this.

01:57:18.114 --> 01:57:19.604
Fall back!

01:57:19.699 --> 01:57:21.281
Everybody out!

01:57:21.368 --> 01:57:23.279
Fall back now!
Go! Go! Go!

01:57:58.697 --> 01:58:00.654
<i>We got a war zone here!</i>

01:58:32.564 --> 01:58:34.271
Shut your eyes.

01:58:40.864 --> 01:58:44.027
Stay here. I'll be back.

01:58:51.875 --> 01:58:54.207
Get down on the floor!
Face down!

01:58:56.921 --> 01:58:58.503
On the floor now!

01:59:00.842 --> 01:59:02.332
Okay, drop him!

02:00:22.215 --> 02:00:23.626
Here, hold this.

02:00:57.041 --> 02:00:58.031
Go!

02:01:36.998 --> 02:01:37.908
Shit!

02:01:51.513 --> 02:01:53.220
Get out.

02:02:12.242 --> 02:02:13.528
Listen.

02:02:13.618 --> 02:02:16.326
No matter what happens,
stay under these vests.

02:02:16.412 --> 02:02:17.652
- You got it?
- Yeah.

02:02:17.747 --> 02:02:19.203
All right.

02:02:33.763 --> 02:02:35.003
Chopper's coming in!

02:02:35.098 --> 02:02:36.213
It's him.

02:03:33.990 --> 02:03:35.321
Shit!

02:03:38.202 --> 02:03:39.988
Stay down!

02:04:54.278 --> 02:04:56.736
Goddamn! You all right?

02:05:04.247 --> 02:05:06.659
Come on, Mom,
we gotta get out.

02:05:08.584 --> 02:05:10.200
Take the shotgun.

02:05:13.464 --> 02:05:15.046
Are you hurt?

02:05:28.229 --> 02:05:31.142
Holy shit.
Come on, Mom. Come on!

02:05:31.232 --> 02:05:33.940
- We need your truck.
- Hurry!

02:05:38.948 --> 02:05:41.440
- Come on. Hurry.
- Get in.

02:05:44.454 --> 02:05:45.660
Go!

02:05:51.669 --> 02:05:53.660
What the hell —

02:05:59.552 --> 02:06:02.294
- I'm bleeding bad.
- Keep pressure on it.

02:06:03.973 --> 02:06:05.634
Here. This'll work.

02:06:11.230 --> 02:06:12.937
He's gaining.

02:06:15.485 --> 02:06:17.146
Step on it!

02:06:17.236 --> 02:06:20.024
- This is the vehicle's top speed.
- I can run faster than this!

02:06:30.875 --> 02:06:32.331
Coming up, to the right.

02:06:34.378 --> 02:06:36.335
Watch it! Watch it!

02:06:58.903 --> 02:07:01.019
- Drive.
- Where are you going?

02:07:08.496 --> 02:07:10.407
Take the off-ramp.

02:07:20.091 --> 02:07:21.252
Shit!

02:07:24.428 --> 02:07:25.509
Hold on!

02:08:11.350 --> 02:08:12.966
Don't stop!

02:08:20.818 --> 02:08:22.229
Go straight!

02:08:24.864 --> 02:08:27.151
- Look out!
- Duck!

02:08:41.297 --> 02:08:43.254
Get the hell outta here!

02:08:48.763 --> 02:08:51.801
Get outta here!
Let's go! Come on!

02:10:08.801 --> 02:10:11.259
<i>Hasta la vista,</i> baby.

02:11:00.853 --> 02:11:02.264
We don't have much time.

02:11:24.877 --> 02:11:26.117
Let's go.

02:11:27.213 --> 02:11:28.999
We gotta get outta here.

02:11:29.090 --> 02:11:31.172
Come on! Get up!

02:11:44.772 --> 02:11:46.479
Hand me the shotgun.

02:11:51.320 --> 02:11:53.607
Put your weight on me, Mom.

02:11:54.407 --> 02:11:56.318
Hurry!

02:11:59.870 --> 02:12:01.486
Come on, Mom.

02:12:08.003 --> 02:12:09.334
Get up!

02:12:40.870 --> 02:12:42.827
This way. Come on.

02:13:09.857 --> 02:13:11.518
No! Wait!

02:13:11.817 --> 02:13:15.731
Wait. No. No.
It's too hot. Go back.

02:13:23.954 --> 02:13:26.195
- Go. Run.
- No! We gotta stick together.

02:13:26.290 --> 02:13:28.281
John, you've got to go now.

02:13:28.375 --> 02:13:30.537
- John!
- Go! Now!

02:14:44.994 --> 02:14:46.780
Get up the steps.

02:14:54.169 --> 02:14:55.659
Get up.

02:14:56.463 --> 02:14:58.625
Come on, Mom.
I got you.

02:15:33.042 --> 02:15:35.374
Grab the chain. Grab it.

02:15:36.754 --> 02:15:39.496
Grab it. Go. Go!

02:15:49.850 --> 02:15:53.184
Mom, come on! Mom!

02:16:42.319 --> 02:16:44.105
Call to John.

02:16:46.907 --> 02:16:48.773
I know this hurts.

02:16:50.577 --> 02:16:52.238
Call John.

02:17:08.637 --> 02:17:11.299
Call to John now.

02:17:13.308 --> 02:17:15.174
Fuck you.

02:20:32.716 --> 02:20:34.172
Help!

02:20:54.821 --> 02:20:56.403
Mom.

02:21:01.620 --> 02:21:03.987
- Help me.
- Get out of the way, John.

02:21:04.957 --> 02:21:07.198
- John! John!
- Shoot!

02:22:03.223 --> 02:22:05.635
Get down!

02:23:38.944 --> 02:23:41.106
Get up. Come on.

02:23:43.365 --> 02:23:45.151
Holy shit.

02:23:45.242 --> 02:23:47.700
I need a vacation.

02:24:00.924 --> 02:24:03.712
Is it dead?

02:24:03.802 --> 02:24:05.213
Terminated.

02:24:08.723 --> 02:24:10.384
Will this melt in there?

02:24:13.353 --> 02:24:15.219
Yes. Throw it in.

02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:24.231
And the chip.

02:24:39.421 --> 02:24:41.037
It's over.

02:24:47.888 --> 02:24:49.549
There's one more chip.

02:24:54.227 --> 02:24:56.468
And it must be destroyed also.

02:25:01.943 --> 02:25:03.525
Here.

02:25:03.612 --> 02:25:06.980
I cannot self-terminate.
You must lower me into the steel.

02:25:20.128 --> 02:25:22.586
I'm sorry, John. I'm sorry.

02:25:22.672 --> 02:25:24.959
No, it'll be okay.
Stay with us.

02:25:25.050 --> 02:25:27.041
- It'll be okay.
- I have to go away.

02:25:27.135 --> 02:25:29.718
No, don't do it.
Please, don't go.

02:25:29.804 --> 02:25:32.887
I must go away, John.

02:25:32.974 --> 02:25:34.430
No, wait.

02:25:34.517 --> 02:25:37.430
- You don't have to do this.
- I'm sorry.

02:25:38.355 --> 02:25:40.596
No, don't do it! Don't go!

02:25:40.690 --> 02:25:42.647
It has to end here.

02:25:43.860 --> 02:25:47.148
I order you not to go!

02:25:55.121 --> 02:25:57.158
I know now why you cry.

02:25:59.542 --> 02:26:02.000
But it's something
I can never do.

02:26:36.329 --> 02:26:38.536
Good-bye.

02:28:17.597 --> 02:28:20.635
<i>The unknown future
rolls toward us.</i>

02:28:20.725 --> 02:28:24.639
<i>I face it for the first time
with a sense of hope.</i>

02:28:24.729 --> 02:28:27.061
<i>Because if a machine,
a Terminator...</i>

02:28:27.148 --> 02:28:30.482
<i>can learn the value
of human life...</i>

02:28:30.568 --> 02:28:32.229
<i>maybe we can too.</i>
